# ICD-10 Code Assistant

A Streamlit web application that analyzes medical transcripts and suggests appropriate ICD-10 codes using AI-powered analysis.

## üìã Project Overview

**Presentation**: [ICD10 Suspecting - Project Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19WlWrMvrAG21bb_FTIAZRshlmc2SsNXsdPUvbaVuIEk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze medical transcripts
- **ICD-10 Code Lookup**: Integrates with ICD-10 alphabetical index and tabular list
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit
- **Detailed Reasoning**: Provides reasoning for each suggested code
- **Processing Log**: Shows detailed steps of the analysis process
- **Export Results**: Download results as JSON/CSV
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment of extracted codes
- **Modular Architecture**: Professional-grade, maintainable codebase

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need an OpenAI API key to use the service
2. **ICD-10 XML Files**: The following files must be in the project directory:
   - `icd10cm_index_2025.xml` (ICD-10 Alphabetical Index)
   - `icd10cm_tabular_2025.xml` (ICD-10 Tabular List)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure XML files are present**:
   - Place `icd10cm_index_2025.xml` and `icd10cm_tabular_2025.xml` in the project directory
   - The app will show file status in the sidebar

## Usage

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_icd_app.py
   ```

2. **Configure the app**:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar
   - Adjust max processing steps if needed (default: 20)

3. **Analyze a transcript**:
   - Paste a medical transcript in the text area
   - Or click "Load Sample Transcript" to use the example
   - Click "üîç Analyze Transcript" to start processing

4. **Review results**:
   - ICD-10 codes will appear in the right column
   - Each code includes reasoning and alternate codes
   - View the processing log to see detailed steps

5. **Export results**:
   - Click "üì• Export Results as JSON" to download the analysis

## Sample Transcript

The app includes a sample transcript for testing:

```
Patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
He presents today with complaints of severe leg pain and swelling in both lower extremities. 
His A1c is 12, indicating poor glycemic control. He is currently on insulin therapy.
Patient also reports high triglycerides and has been diagnosed with hypertension.
BMI is 39, indicating class 2 obesity. There are concerns about diabetic neuropathy 
and potential peripheral artery disease affecting blood supply to the legs.
Patient has poor wound healing and kidney function needs monitoring.
```

## How It Works

1. **AI Analysis**: The system uses a specialized prompt to guide GPT-4 through ICD-10 coding
2. **Tool Calls**: The AI makes function calls to:
   - `lookup_alphabetical_index()` - Search for conditions
   - `lookup_tabular_list()` - Get detailed code information
   - `create_icd10_suspect_entry()` - Create code entries with reasoning
3. **Iterative Process**: The AI continues until all relevant codes are identified
4. **Results**: Final results include codes, reasoning, and alternate options

## üìÅ Project Structure - Refactored Architecture

The application has been refactored from a single 827-line file into a maintainable, modular structure:

### Core Files

- **`streamlit_icd_app.py`** (120 lines) - Main application entry point
  - Clean, focused main function
  - High-level orchestration
  - Input validation and error handling

- **`ui_components.py`** (372 lines) - All UI components and styling
  - Custom CSS styling
  - Sidebar configuration
  - Results display components
  - Export functionality
  - Processing details display

- **`icd_processing.py`** (150 lines) - Streamlit-specific pipeline wrapper
  - Uses working functions from `pipeline_functions.py`
  - Progress tracking and UI integration
  - Data parsing utilities
  - Session state management

- **`pipeline_functions.py`** (246 lines) - Core business logic
  - Working ICD-10 extraction pipeline
  - Gemini API integration
  - Preprocessing and confidence scoring
  - Proven functionality from notebook

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **UI Logic**: All Streamlit components isolated in `ui_components.py`
- **Business Logic**: Core processing logic in `pipeline_functions.py`
- **UI Integration**: Streamlit wrapper in `icd_processing.py`
- **Main App**: Clean orchestration in `streamlit_icd_app.py`

### 2. **Better Code Organization**
- **Smaller Functions**: Long functions broken down into focused, single-purpose functions
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive function and variable names
- **Logical Grouping**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Reuse Existing Code**: Leverages proven working functions

### 3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- **Modular Design**: Easy to modify individual components
- **Reusable Components**: UI components can be reused
- **Testable Code**: Business logic separated from UI for easier testing
- **Error Handling**: Centralized validation and error handling

## üìà Refactoring Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Main file size | 827 lines | 120 lines | 85% reduction |
| Longest function | 200+ lines | <50 lines | 75% reduction |
| Cyclomatic complexity | High | Low | Much more readable |
| Separation of concerns | None | Clear | Fully modular |
| Code duplication | High | Minimal | DRY principle applied |

## Configuration

- **Model**: Uses GPT-4 (gpt-4o) by default
- **Max Steps**: Configurable via sidebar (5-50 steps)
- **XML Files**: Must be in project directory with exact filenames

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing XML Files**: Ensure both XML files are in the project directory
2. **API Key Issues**: Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. **Processing Errors**: Check the processing log for detailed error information
4. **No Results**: Try adjusting the transcript or increasing max processing steps

## Security Notes

- API keys are entered as password fields and not stored
- All processing happens locally except for OpenAI API calls
- No transcript data is permanently stored
