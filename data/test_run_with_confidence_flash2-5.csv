Did you actually got that sorted out, the, the billing issue and all that? Uh, a little bit, yes. Somewhat, somewhat, at least thank God you're able to see me. Yes.

So, Carlos, I'm actually using, it's, it's my helper, I would say, it helps me type everything. It doesn't record or anything, so I can talk to you more. Yeah.

Let's recap everything about you, right? Okay. Um, I know you've been out of your medications because of all this issue. Yeah. Um, insurance and all that for the last three months. Is that right? Or two months? It's been a while. It's been a while? When was the last time you actually took your medications? Can you tell me a rough estimate? So we're in what, August right now? Two months. Two months or a few months? A few months probably. You mean March, April maybe? Maybe. March, April? Wow. That's a long time. Yeah.

Okay, so just to recap everything, when you were taking your meds, so let's say October, you were taking insulin? Yes. Is that right? Okay. Was the insulin, do you know, would you happen to know? I know Lily wrote like, uh, Glargine, Basiglar, Pen. Would you happen to know how much were you injecting? Or you're not sure? Fifteen in the morning and, uh, twenty-five at night. Fifteen in the morning, okay. And twenty-five units at bedtime, correct? Okay.

ulld do you remember when you were taking this regimen, were you checking your blood sugars in the morning and the evening? No. Not regularly. Not regularly. Today I kind of pretty much knew, uh, that's a good time to start over here. You're pretty much here. Yeah. Let's start over, exactly. So, I'll be right back. Let me bring my notepad because I'll give you some notes today, okay? Okay. Okay.

Okay, so, uh, let's start over in general, like everything, right? So, I mean, I'm assuming your A1c would be high because, uh, this goes without a question, right? Um, I wonder your last A1c. See, with this epic, I have to kind of juggle what was your last numbers. Uh, let's see if I can pull up. So, iron, your A1c was not there. It's so strange. I think it was like twelve. Was it twelve? Okay. I would imagine, right? It was definitely in the higher side.

So, either way, what I'm going to do is I'm going to recalculate your dose of insulin. This is why I bring my notepad. So, your weight is how many? 139 kilos, right? Yeah. That's what it says. 307 pounds. Sounds about right? Okay. So, what we are going to do is we're going to calculate, and I'm going to use my calculator. I'm going to answer this real quick. Yeah. I am going to talk to the hospital. Okay. Sorry. No, that's okay. So, 139 divided by 2. Okay. So, what includes?

That you came. I know. They're like really worried about you. So, 139 kilos divided by 2. 669 and 69. Okay. So, 669. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

69 divided by 2 okay so right now would you happen to know when you would check your sugars on this 15 in the morning and 25 at bedtime would you would you happen to know were they still high around 200 in the morning right low for me that was low for you around 200 was low for you wow like this to get it yeah yeah that's starting to get my sugar yeah turn around 200 got it area you know yeah 190s and stuff like that like that yeah that was a lot for me that was a lot normally high right so remember your goal should be because you are so young right fasting blood sugars should be below 130. I know it sounds weird and an alien concept for you because you've never been that way but that is what my goal is with you fasting i'm experiencing a lot of things now i know i know very bad that exactly so we'll talk more about it but my goal with you is 130 and below fasting during the during the day i want you to be below 200 sorry below 180 not 200 below 180 okay so what we are going to do is your dose comes about 30 so 69 divided by 69 divided by 2 okay so 69 divided by 2 so you will be injecting 34 units actually in the morning and 34 units at bedtime because based on your weight that's what the dose is right now so although you're telling me what the regimen you know that you were injecting before it sounds like they were still high 200s right so based on your weight and kind of recalculating everything let's start at this point so i'm going to send a prescription of this insulin which is the um what is that basic lab right where is it med management maybe okay here basic lab okay so basic lab will be 34 units in the morning and 34 units at bedtime okay so what you're going to do is in morning and bedtime now you're gonna check your blood sugars i'm gonna send a did you remember if the glucose sensor was approved by insurance or no or you're not sure i have it you have it glucose sensor wow how did you get that i think they gave it to me really they gave it to you but you haven't used it because you didn't have insulin right okay at least you have it right perfect fantastic is it freestyle liberty or freestyle you have everything right amazing so before breakfast and before dinner is what you're going to check remember fbs is fasting blood sugar below 130 random blood sugar rbs during the day which is before dinner below 180 okay 34 units in am and pm okay if the blood sugars are very low hold if blood sugar bs is blood sugar okay not not bullshit blood sugar below 120 if it's very low then you don't you have to hold yourself so this is one homework so obviously i would i have to keep a close eye on you until this is sorted out so you're gonna have maintain the blood sugar for two weeks write down the numbers of course and then i have to see you back in two weeks again okay so let me convert this into a prescription uh she wrote the prescription so it's going to be 34 units 34 units subcutaneously b.i.d meaning two times a day and 30 Okay, well I'm going to say give enough supply for one month. Okay, so that's one thing I want you to take care of. Okay, so let's keep moving.

When you say, when you're experiencing lots of symptoms, right, tell me what are your symptoms? I don't know if you remember me telling you about a year or over ago that my legs were swelling. I had to ask you all that. My legs were swelling real bad. Yes. So now I'm losing my ability to walk. Yes. I'm losing my stability. Walking up the stairs is a big task. What happens to you when you walk upstairs? This is in the morning time. This is in the morning. At night, my legs are like... Big. Elephant size. So swelling at leg, of the leg is more at night. Well, yes. Higher at night than in the morning. And it used to just be from here down. Yes. Travelers. Traveler. Okay. Okay. But, you know... And any time you walk, the pain gets worse in your legs? Is that right? Yes. Okay. Yeah.

Remember, we were concerned about your blood supply, right? When you saw the podiatrist... I went to the... Yeah. I went to the heart doctor. Yes. I took the... I took the stress test. I did not go back for the echogram. Okay. I just did the stress test. Okay. So I never followed up. So you never followed up.

So that's one... That's one opportunity. You need to. Actually, when I was reading his notes, I can, you know, tell you exactly what he wrote, right? So, first of all, he said he was also concerned about your legs, right? So, basically, he said you saw the podiatrist and he didn't see the results, but at that point, I think you were referred to a vascular surgeon? Yes. Because there was a concern for blood flow supply. Right. So when I went to the... When I went to the... Vascular person? Yeah. They were like, no, they don't have... Who did you go to see them? They called it a... It was a... He said they don't... They don't have a... Dang. It was a... He said they don't... They don't... You don't have any problems with your muscles? No. No. He said I have no problems with that. I need to know the name. And I never got the results from them. Yeah. It was a... Maybe last month. My fianc√©e, she might remember. Okay. But, yeah. Because when I was at the podiatrist, he was like, oh, no, you have... Yeah. Man, what was that? He said I had a... Your podiatrist was concerned about the legs? Yeah.

Right? Blood supply? Yes, because my legs were swollen. Correct. He said the reason I don't have hair on my legs. Yes. Yes. Exactly. And I tried to explain to him, like, I never had hair on my legs. Yeah. I never had... Yeah. He understood that or whatever. And he was like, no, look, you're... Yeah. But anyway, so I went to a specialist in Skylar Woodlands for... Okay. That looked through my veins. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I went to the specialist and they were like, no, look, you don't have any blood in your veins. They said, just look at my veins, it's not there. And they were like, no, you don't have no blood or anything like that. What's the name of the, of this, of the group you said? Woodlands something? It was in the woodlands. In the woodlands. Okay. Yeah. And they were specifically for... Yeah.

For the vessels? Yeah. For the vessels. See, did they do some, like, so they did ultrasound and everything? Yeah. They did ultrasounds, they looked at, yeah, those cells all looked in here, the legs and just to know what they were like. And did we do any... I don't know. I don't think so. Okay. Because I want to make sure that there is... I want to make sure... I don't see any recent ultrasound of your veins done, to be honest. You said my veins? Veins. Like V-E-I-N-S. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins. Veins, like V-E-I-N-S. Veins. Yeah. There's two kinds of blood supply, right? Veins. Veins. If there's a problem in either or, it can give you symptoms like that.

So either way, I want to make sure that there's no blood clot in the legs, right? So any time you have pain in the legs and swelling, that is one thing that I get concerned about. So I'm going to put like a stat order today to get the ultrasound of your wings.

You mentioned- Have you ever wore ankle weights, doctor? Have you ever wore ankle weights? Do you know what ankle weights are? Ankle weights? Ankle weights, whenever you put like these things on people who exercise, they put these things- Yeah, yeah, yeah, ankle weights, okay. That's how I feel when I walk. See, I am still concerned about the blood supply. And my stability is horrible. Like for my kids, when they go and they're walking with me, they cut in front of me. I can fall down, like I'm having a lot of issues. I want to get a, you know, A, I'm going to have you go see Dr. Ahmad again, you saw Dr. Ahmad, okay? Right. M-U-R-T-A-Z-A. Call his office today, please, and schedule an appointment. I don't, I mean, I can put out a referral again. I'll call. Call him, right? Yeah, please call him. Just in case, I'll put a referral, but call him, schedule an appointment.

I am still not convinced at this time that, you know, arteries are okay because you are describing lots of symptoms with blood vessel problems, to be honest. These are my average feet. Yeah, that's crazy. My feet don't look like this. My feet, you're able to see them. I know. So let's do three things again. I just wonder why I'm getting an ultrasound. Let me do an ultrasound again of your arteries and veins. Repeat the ultrasound. Also, when you see Dr. Ahmad, he needs to do an echocardiogram on you because if there is change in heart function, then you can have swelling in your legs too. Okay? So ultrasound, I'm putting the orders right now. This is the number you're going to call, okay? Let me see if I can find that order here. Okay. Ultrasound, let me add that. Okay. Will you be a radiology. This will be stat and say bilateral leg pain and swelling. So that's one thing and then let me put the diagnosis so we can cover your study here. Bilateral leg pain. Let's see if I can pull up the diagnosis here and then ultrasound, arterial, lower extremity, arterial, bilateral. Okay. That's the one I'm looking for. This will be stat, radiology, bilateral leg pain and swelling. Okay. That is done. And then also cardiology referrals. She had gluten syrup. Okay. Hey, I'm here with the doctor. Do you remember the thing that the podiatrist told me to go to the specialist about when I went to that specialist? Do you remember what it was called? No, I know she didn't say that your arteries were clear. Yeah, I understand why your arteries were clear but the doctor was asking what was the name of the doctor, what was the name of the building, what was the name of the anything or anything. If you see, if you see any of it, can you take a turn? Okay, so Alex, if she wanted to know, if she wanted to know where did that podiatrist, the one that took the artist into the service of the girls, she wanted to know where she was taking me? No, the test they did, what was it for? That they said that my arteries were, do you remember when I went to the podiatrist, he told me, no, you have to go to an artery doctor. What was that, artery doctor, what did he say I had? The podiatrist, he told me to go get checked for something lacking in my arteries. I know they said I didn't have it, but the doctor wants to know, what did they say I didn't have? That's okay, anyway we are recapping everything, we might just want to recap this.

So that's one thing, right, second of all, I want you to be back on the cholesterol medication, Lipitor, 80 milligrams, okay, at bedtime. So when you were taking Lipitor, you didn't have any side effects, correct? Okay, so I want you to be back on it because that is very important just for your heart and overall for your health issues, right, for your diabetes. So I'm giving you a 90-day supply with one refill because I just want you to have enough. It's taken at bedtime, okay, so it's a high-intensity statin to protect you from heart attack and stroke. Also, can you start taking a baby aspirin daily, 81 milligrams? Do you need a prescription for that or can you buy it over the counter, right? Okay, so baby aspirin, insulin, cholesterol.

Let's talk about your blood pressure. So what Dr. Ahmad wrote about you and blood pressure is, basically what you're going to do is, we wanted you to be on Valsartan, right, 160 milligrams daily, along with hydrochlorothiazide, that was a diuretic to pull that extra fluid out from your legs. It was a combination pill. No, see, there was confusion there. Yeah. I told him, I got that from you. Okay. You gave me something. Okay. And he said, well, then I'll give you like two or three pills till you come back and see me whenever you get your echo and then we'll go from there. Okay. Because he was worried about my kidney function. He said, have you seen the kidney doctor yet? Yes. I said, no, not yet. Yes, so that was another thing. Yeah. That's not, he said it's not his specialty or something like that. So he don't want to give me too strong of a diuretic without knowing what the kidney doctor is. Talking to a kidney doctor. It's true, it's true, absolutely.

So what I would do is, did you have like already a kidney doctor that you were? No. So I'll put out an urgent referral again. What is your insurance? Aetna. Aetna, okay. So I'm assuming it should not be a problem here. So what I would do. Peripheral artery disease. Peripheral artery disease is what the podiatrist told me that he thought I had. And so the specialist, I went to go see, was a PAD specialist inside the woodlands. When I went to do the echograms and the, not echograms, ultrasounds or whatever it was on my legs, they were like, no, you don't have that. Your arteries are fine. So they said you could go see a doctor. Renal specialist. Yeah, but it is your arteries. Okay, okay. Yeah, I'd love to get their records if they can request the records. Yeah, that's fine. Let me just, you know, 90 days and one, okay.

So I'll just, you know, I just want to recap the ultrasound again, just because it's just something bothers me about your symptoms. But what I would do is I would start you back on at least Ralsartan, 160 milligrams daily. And again, that what I would. do is, I would, that's true, you know, what happens is you need like lots of diuresis, meaning the water needs to come out from the legs because it's part of swelling and that can affect the kidney function, but it's just like we have to carefully, you know, handle your kidney function because too much of a diuretic can also dry you out, so we have to maintain a balance. So what I would do is, I would, I'm going to put out an urgent referral to the kidney specialist, can you give me that paper? So I'll write down her name, Dr. Patel, okay? Dr. Patel, I want you to see her as soon as possible, but I really think at least I can get you back on that Welzartin and hydrochlorothiazide. I feel like we need to, we need to put some... And that's once a day? That's once a day, exactly. In the morning or night? In the morning, you can take it once a day because if it's a diuretic, it's going to, you know, take the fluid out. So I know I'm not big on pain and medication, I've never taken any medication before. Yeah, but can I give you Welzartin and hydrochlorothiazide? Yeah. At least you can start taking it. I'll take it, I'll take it.

Because I agree, your kidney function needs to be watched closely, which is why when I see you back in two weeks while you're taking Welzartin and hydrochlorothiazide, I want you to not only, you know, record your blood pressure, remember? In the morning and in the evening, okay? With this one. So Welzartin, hydrochlorothiazide, okay? Welzartin is what? 160, 12.5. Morning and evening. Goal should be below 140 over 90, okay? Is this two pills or just one pill? One pill, combination, yeah. Let me put the orders in real quick. Welzartin and hydrochlorothiazide, it's, okay, so it's 160 by 12.5, that's what I'm, okay. Alright, so I'm giving you 160 and then 30 days. Now I'm not giving you any refills, okay? For only 30 days. Because I want to see you back in two weeks. Yes, exactly. I need to know what's happening, right? So I'll say, remember, hold if BP is less than 120 over 60. If it's very low, then of course we don't take it, okay? Okay, so one more thing.

Okay, you were talking about some pain. So your pain is in the legs? My pain is unreal. I walk every day is a real task. So my jobs, you know, I walk, you know, not all day long on my feet, but I'm in a lot of pain.

So what I would do is, here's the thing, while I'm sending you to all these doctors to establish care again, so there's three things that can contribute to your pain right now. One, of course, is arterial, which sounds like it's not the problem, but I'll recheck it again. Second of all, there is blood clot in the veins. I'll get that, you know, figured out through ultrasound of the veins. Third, and the most important is diabetic neuropathy, right? And that can be constantly patient can be in pain, constantly, you know, miserable, that sort of thing. And I do remember, I don't know if I prescribed you Tramadol. I did prescribe you Tramadol. I never picked it up. Okay. Okay. When I tried to pick it up, they said, No, you got to see your doctor. Yeah. So I just never got it. But I got it. I would. Yeah. Well, because what to take it now. Sure. Right. So the problem is, basically, what I would do is I can give you that's fine. But I also want you to see vein management, Dr. Bennett, Rachel Bennett. k-h-u-o-r-y because remember I told you there is amazing treatment options out there, remember? That doesn't involve pain meds, it can actually interfere with you, remember electrical signals? Because I feel like that is also going to be an amazing, amazing option for you. See, I want to improve, I don't want you to be like a drug addict, okay? I want you to actually be able to live like a normal person, you know, without pain. That's what my goal is with you. That was my biggest concern of course, you know. With being pain meds and all that, right?

This is why I'm going to send a pain management referral to you as well. And that way I can have you see a doctor. I know Dr. Daniel Bennett does it because he, you know, where is it? So he actually introduced me, you know, his team introduced me to this idea. So stat, pain management, it's consult and treat, and acute pain. Needs to see Daniel, I'm putting Bennett, okay? So please see him as soon as possible. And then I'm placing urgent referral too. And then July fall I'm also doing Tramadol, okay. No.

Metformin, right? No, not, were you taking metformin? No, we haven't started. No, no, not right now because until this kidney function thing is figured out. I have seen Farsega commercially. Yes. I had taken Farsega before, like a few years ago. Tramadol. I don't know. That's right, that's correct. I was going to ask you what you thought about that.

You know, Farsega is a good medication for diabetic kidney disease. It can increase the risk of urinary infection. But I want you to talk to a kidney doctor before we start in that journey. Okay. I think Tramadol has a kidney impairment dose. Okay, let me figure it out what your kidney function is. The problem with kidney function Tramadol is it gets cleared through kidneys. And I don't have your updated kidney function. I would only use the Tramadol for events. I know, I know. Correct. No, you're fasting today, right? Okay. Why don't I get your kidney function? And my kidney function will be back not too long. You know, let me make sure your kidney function is safe for me to give Tramadol. I don't mind giving Tramadol at all until you see the pain management. But I want to make sure. Yeah, yeah. Just to make sure because I don't even know what's your kidney function right now. No, no, I hear you. I hear you. Sure, sure. No, I'd like to just make sure just to be on the safe side.

But I'm getting all labs on you. And so what I did today was just to make sure. No, it's okay. So I did basically, let me sign all these referrals. I sent a referral to sign the orders. Okay. Let me do diagnosis association here. Okay. So diabetes and then ultrasound. Peripheral vascular disease and bilateral. That's okay. Okay. And then was your stress test with the normal limits? I don't know. I never went back for the test. You never went back? So just make sure. Okay. So cardiology referral, right? Urine test, urine for protein test, vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels also. And then vitamin B12 and iron because you were low on all these. I'd like to see where do you stand right now. Okay. Yeah, when I was in the hospital, they would tell me that. Yes, yes. Vitamin D and vitamin B12. Right, because if your iron levels are still low, I'd like to see where you stand, then I have to make sure you're not losing blood from your, you know, stomach. That is what I want to make sure that's not what you're having. Okay. And then pain management is this one. Okay, so I'm signing all these orders in, I will get your results.

ulld then, and your trial list rights are very high. Also, I'm going to hook you up with a diabetic educator, because your trial list rights were so high. Lily, get out of the chart, please. Okay. Okay, I'm putting you through diabetic educator, also stat, individual diabetes educations. Okay. I feel like someone also needs to help you navigating day to day situation. There you go. Okay.

ulld then, um, any other symptoms, new symptoms like chest pain, trouble breathing, palpitations? No, no. Okay. Just your heart rate, of course, you know, was blood pressures were high, right? Well, you were saying something else? It's galluses. These are cuts. How are you getting these cuts? So I got this one at work when I was grabbing something.

What work do you do? Construction, construction. It was just a little spray. But whenever I get any type of like, yeah, mosquito bite. Yeah. Mosquito bites. Yeah. But when I scratch them, like since I'm diabetic, I guess it doesn't heal properly. And then that scarred me. And it doesn't heal properly because your A1C is high, right? That's all connected. This right here was just a little spray. This right here, same thing. Like I grabbed something and I sprayed my hand on the concrete. How long has it been like this? This, like a few weeks, a few weeks. It don't, like everything just doesn't heal as easy as it used to heal. Correct. Whenever anything happens, I get scars. I get scars.

Now that's, I'm thinking it's because of the diabetes. Oh, it has to be because of the diabetes. Because any other time it's not healing well, who knows what your A1C is right now. And that's very important for wound healing. Why don't you start, did you apply Aquaphor on it? Why don't you start applying Aquaphor on it every day? Every day, every day until I see you next time. Because if it's not, you know, it's almost sounds like a calisthropy because it's not hurting you. But every day apply Aquaphor for the next two weeks. And then if it's not improving, then I'll send you to a dermatologist at that time to get it removed. Okay. In fact, I haven't done a physical on you. When I see you back in two weeks, I will do a physical on you. Okay, follow up. Okay, follow up. Let me just do that. Okay, perfect.

Alright, so I've sent all these prescriptions to your pharmacy, blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication, insulin, baby aspirin. Right? These are the three things. And three doctors, actually pain management, heart doctor, kidney doctor. And there was one more. Diabetes education. Wait, ultrasound. Yes, ultrasound. So much homework, okay?

No chest pain, trouble breathing. Also, I think we need to help you lose weight as well, those weight loss injections, ozempic examples. Did you get that before? No, I hadn't. People in New York City had a bad experience with it. Oh, you had? Oh, that's right. No, no, no. Thank you for reminding me. You had a really bad reaction. Yeah. I'm also going to then send you, I don't want to take chances on you, I don't want to give you meds that can... I'm going to put you to Memorial Hermann Weight Loss Clinic. I really think, you know, they have... Question. Yes. What do you feel about... Vigovi is the same. Weight loss surgery.

Weight loss surgery, that's also a good idea, but insurance will not approve if you have not tried weight loss meds, which is why I think having you see the weight loss clinic will be a good idea. Okay. I really think so. If I can find that referral. Okay.

So tomorrow, I call this number, all these referrals should be there. Yes. Yes. Everything. I'm putting it everything right now here. All right. Well, I'm actually going to put down... See, I can't find weight loss. I'm just going to say Medical Management Clinic. That's what I'm doing, and I'm going to say needs to see... They are in Woodlands, okay? MHMG Weight Loss Clinic. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Weight Loss Clinic.

Everything is signed, you are going to go in the front, get the blood work done. Let's have Lily just check you blood, what do you say, blood pressure again. Okay? VMI is 39. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Done. I'm signing the referral, okay? Alright my dear, and I'm hoping that when we come and see each other, then we have, you know, workup done. Alright? So, I'll let you go in the, first I'll leave you in the room, then I'll let you go in the front. When I see your kidney function, if it's acceptable, I will automatically send the primadom. Okay? Alright my dear, take care, and I know it was a lot, but I have faith in you. My hope is to get you to a stable point, in a pain-free life, and excellent control diabetes. Okay? Take care. Bye-bye. Sure. How are you? How are you? How are you?","[{'reasoning': 'The patient has a long-standing history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, which is currently uncontrolled due to medication non-adherence.

I am a pediatric provider, and I'm just going in to see a patient, and mom is Spanish speaking. Okay, I'm about to go in. Hi. Hola. Alrighty. Interpreter, you want to introduce yourself? Okay. Alrighty, so how's our throat feeling? Ya, ya se siente mejor. Okay, good.

So, we're just reviewing that blood work we did, and she definitely is still anemic. Okay. Are we currently taking any type of iron supplement? Okay, and it has iron in it? Si, si. Okay, so I definitely want you to be taking that every day. Has she been taking that every day? No. Okay, so it looks like we're still anemic. So just since I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients in that supplement that mom's talking about, I'm going to go ahead and send in a little daily iron supplement just to make sure that it has that iron that we want in it. Sometimes insurances are kind of picky about covering the supplement since it's technically over the counter. So if they're saying they're not going to pay for it, then you might have to buy it over the counter. But we'll see if insurance covers. Okay, but yes, her hemoglobin, which we want higher than 11.5, hers was 10.4.

Okay, and then there was another little thing on her blood count that's called monocytes. Those are a little bit elevated. This is usually our immune system, and it was probably elevated from her strep and flu infections. All righty, so I want you to be taking this supplement every day with some orange juice, and then we'll recheck her hemoglobin level. in two months. Her throat is looking much better. She does not need another dose of the flu vaccine because we got her records and I pulled them all over and she already got two doses. So she doesn't need that second dose. All righty, we'll all get that sent over to a HealthStore Clinic and you guys are good to go. And if you want to go ahead and make that two-month appointment at the front, you can, or you can wait until it gets a little bit closer. Okay, well you guys have a good rest of your Monday.

Are you happy? Mm-hmm. I like it. I like it too, man. It looks good. It looks good. Yeah, that, uh, man, it started with the maze, then I got that thing, and now I'm just occupying all my time doing that stuff. I don't know how to do the maze completed other than how it shows it to. With the canoodle you made? Mm-hmm. Oh, it's impressive because definitely a source of frustration for me. Less treating you all right? Mm-hmm. I'm super happy about that. I feel like I've been having better behavior at once and stuff and I've been just like, I've just been, I feel like I've been just not like trying, like not talking back and stuff. I like that, what's changed, what's different, how have you done that? Controlled my urge to argue with her every five seconds.

She looks backwards. I see. All right. All right. So not the exact same. I gotcha. It's creative. Well, that's awesome about controlling that urge. Is it pretty natural for you to like, I don't know, argue is the right word, but when somebody says something, do you kind of... Take the opinion opposite them. I mean, no, but like if I have a different thought or I have a thought that I feel is better than me. Yeah. I gotcha. Can I play with the Mr. Potato Head? It's totally fine with me. It might be a little dusty. Where are all the parts? I think in here. Oh! That's it. Those are the parts. Nothing, nothing inside. Well, that's awesome. And things are going well with you?

Yeah, really, really well. I freaking love it. Yeah. All right. Was it the hair? Is that what's making you want to argue all the time? Man. I need something better. I need, I have like stuff. a lot of incomplete stuff for younger kids, then there's like, oh the canoodles, like the best I got, I need something for, for you guys that are a little bit older, yeah. It's a cyclops. Well, are you ready to go back to school? Yeah. I like it. You're going to be at The Health Center again? Yeah, for until 8th grade. Okay. You liked it there, okay, right? Mm-hmm, I loved it there. Sweet. Sweet. Well, I love it. Anything do you want to add? Me? Yeah. Um, no, I think... Yeah, that was kind of the biggest thing was just like kind of just arguing with her and it sounds like everything's kind of settling down pretty good over there. That's awesome. Maybe just like the family dynamic is kind of settling down over there. Sure. The sunray lid, just kind of like, things are kind of falling into place, a little bit more comfortable with the new stepdad and everything. It's a big change, I didn't know about that. It's a lot to adjust to. Yeah. He's very surprised. No, he's angry. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and I just, yeah, I just found that, like, just, he understands, I think, respect more than... anything else, like if he feels respect, he's a lot more apt. Sure, I think that's a great trait in a lot of ways.

Yeah, no, it's, it's good, it's, he's very, yeah, yeah, I agree, yeah, I don't, him and I have always kind of had that level of respect, like, growing up, like, I was always, like, the, like, the peacekeeper of the house. Sure. And I liked him stuff, so, and I would, yeah, deal with him, like, get to his level of talking to him. Sure, easier said than done sometimes. Oh for sure, I mean... I kind of like them like that, to be honest. You can get behind that. They look really, really well, though. Well, I'm super... I'm pumped to hear all this stuff, man. Yeah, it's been like, it's been a good month or so, like, because he would call me during the week sometimes, just being like, meh. Then I actually, she would call me, she's like, and like I haven't had those calls in the past month, so I feel like it's been a lot smoother. Awesome, that's awesome. That is awesome. Way to be, man. Way to be. How long ago did you cut your hair? Last week. Okay. Alright, I'm to that point where I gotta decide. I gotta commit. If I'm gonna go long again or it's time for a haircut for sure. Dude, go long. It's fine. Dude, I would love, I used to have super long hair and I'm like thinning up here and like having longer hair just makes it like stand out like so much more. So, say less, that's it, I'm done. It was just getting in the way because I wouldn't remember to take care of it, so I was just like, I should just cut it. It's getting in the way. I get that for sure. Yeah, I miss my long hair. And I was trying to grow it out because I could see that it was stinging. I need to grow it out one more time. It was just so blatant that I was like fending it off. It's over. No more long hair. Yeah, I've, it's, I cut it in March and pretty much I've regretted it since.

Oh, I did like super- Super potato, super spud man, that's what you call him. Yeah, oh, flying does, man. Nose bomb. Nose balm. Well, that's freaking awesome. I'm super pumped about it. I appreciate you coming in. Well, dude, he doesn't even need a nose, man. That's what I'm talking about. Now he's perfect. All he needs is a cape, but he doesn't have one all over. Oh, I think I can be a good wrench for that. Just for him. Will that hat stay on? Dude, it sure will. Yeah, so giving that to you was the right decision. It's definitely been improved, ma'am. All right. Well, I super love it. I'm going to put in here three months for the follow-up. anything you need in between, don't hesitate to let me know. Yeah. But. You said them up there, it was like this. Yeah. Amen. Amen. What if I got him like hanging off the corner a little bit? Yeah, perfect. Yeah, that'll do.

That's fair. His hat needs to be backwards. That's fair. Alright. My name is Cheerful Charlie and I think I'm kind of cool. No, no, no. Oh yeah, it's... Yo, my name is Cheerful Charlie, and I think I kind of rock. You can hear me as a musical when I'm flying down the block. Ooh, all right. Yo, my name is Cheerful Charlie, and I really like to rap. I'm looking really cool with my backwards cap. Bam! Who knew the rhymes were in here? Oh, boy, there's a great game. His name is Cheerful Charlie. I'll get behind him, Cheerful Charlie. There's a board game called Rhymantics, and I think that you would dominate it. It's basically what you just did. Rhymantics? It's called Rhymantics, and there's like a- There's a YouTube channel with like minute-long beats and basically you just make up rap for a minute. That's what- I just learned that you would dominate that game. Yeah, that's what we do at home all the time is we just like we listen to like, um- Lo-fi and like chill stuff. Sure. And stuff. So I've learned how to beatbox really well. Yeah, so we beatbox. Heck yeah. And just rap at each other like all the time. I love it, man. It's awesome. I love it. I love it. I think if you can be good with words, you can put them in places where they don't normally go, maybe. Oh, that just opens up a whole world of explanation. And exploration, I guess.

ulld I love it. Well, keep up the great work. I'll be right here if you need me, but I'll plan on seeing you in a few months. That sounds great. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

And I didn't want to talk about vaccines, though I did text Alex and say, do you want him to get a flu shot and COVID if he can get it? Yeah. If he can see we're here. Yeah, he can. I mean. Yeah. He was enrolled in every vaccine trial there ever was because his dad is an infectious disease killer.

Yeah. But I don't know what this whole generation, are you that generation that just... But, you know, since he gave me a letter that I can make a medical decision that he can get me together. I mean, why not? Exactly. Especially a flu shot. 100%. Tis the season. But then, yes, come after your birthday. come for your 10-year checkup. Once a year? Just come once a year? You don't just come? Yeah, you come once a year for a checkup. Yes. There's other issues. Exactly. I mean, it's nice when there's not, but you know, we still like to do what's going on with you. Yeah. So what's going on right now?

Sounds like you've been coughing for a long time. Yeah. Coughing, coughing, coughing, and he the last two weeks has been a lot of coughing with congestion and stuff, and then we, he started using a humidifier and changed the air filter, and he says that's better, but it still is chronic, and I was saying, I noticed, because I take him to swim team, I'm kind of- Yeah. And he did this all summer, but it's gotten worse. He just can't breathe when he's, like, he freestyles on the pool and he gets to, like, the end of the first 25 yards and he's swimming like this. Yeah. And just like when he's swimming, breaststroke, you can see him just, like he just can't, he just, to me, he just can't get air in, because he's got the strength to do it. Yeah. So, I don't know, because dad had, both of my sons. As well. Not my dog. Yeah. Well, we never called it As well, we called it Reactive Airway. But, and they both grew- Grew out of it, but they both had inhalers when they were younger because it just, you know, we had nights when it was just like. Yeah, well, and swimming is notorious. Yeah. For causing, you know, just because you're, you know, you constantly are inhaling kind of the irritant. Yeah. You know, the chlorine, and so it's not an uncommon. Again, time to need it. So you don't necessarily need it except for, you know, a couple of puffs before swim practice or, you know, meets or whatnot. And then obviously if you get sick and you're coughing and congested, you know, it's hard for the cough to... go away. Yeah. It's hard for the cough to go away when everything just is kind of, you know, you just have that tendency to kind of stay inflamed.

Oh yeah. You know, and then, and then we're still swimming. I know. So then, yeah. But then, you know, I'm just like, I sit in the car on the way to practice and I'm like, I can't. I can't take it anymore. It's not, it's just a cough that needed to be seen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So fevers or anything at any time or never even started with one? Probably I don't know that anybody, I've taken it over time, but no, nothing really. Nothing of a measure. Did we have upper congestion? Last week. Was it last week you were a little snotty? Yeah. I didn't take any medication or anything for it, and I started to bring the humidifier and that got better, so I don't, and the way we're built are. Yeah. But. He's come clearer here than he was last week. Yeah, yeah. So again, it may just be that lingering, the lingering thought, no vomiting or diarrhea or eating fine. Yeah. We're sleeping okay? We're coughing at night? Is the cough waking us up at night? It happened like last week, like once, but that was... Well, I think nobody slept last week and then there's...

It's through the night, but he's not waking up. Last week, he couldn't sleep. Okay, so again, it sounds like better, but not. What happened to your foot? I broke it last weekend while running. Yeah. All kinds of fun when you stand for a living. Right. Thank you. Okay. You're all kinds of wheezy. Yeah, I mean, otherwise, it looks okay, but we're definitely wheezy, junky, cruddy. I think inhaler for sure. He's never used an inhaler before. No. Okay. So we'll do the inhaler with the spacer and the mask. Okay. You know, so that you do a pump and then, you know, as you learn to do it, you'll get better at it, but you can do a pump and then. you know, you can breathe five, six times and just breathe, or it works even better if you take a very big breath and hold it for 10 seconds and then do another puff. take a very big breath and hold it for 10 seconds. But again, it'll work because it holds it in the chamber so you can just breathe. Okay. And he, and that's what, what kind of inhaler? The albuterol. Oh, the albuterol. Yeah. Yeah, I think we, you know, let's start with that. I think he needs it now, I would do it, you know, before school, after school, before bed, I would just, because he is wheezy, and that's just part of... the crud, and then I think two puffs, you know, before meets, before swim, before, before, you know, any exercise like that I think will be very helpful. I think of course the steroids would help him exponentially right now just because we are so inflamed from whichever virus we've got going on, you know, whichever junk and crud and junk and crud.

ulld I think we start with that. I mean, it sounds like we're better. Like it sounds like symptoms from last week, you know, the congestion is better. You know, coughing at night is improved. Like we're on the mend. Now we're wheezing. So now the inflammation is just there. Okay. So I think that's all we need to do as your body heals. I don't think this is anything, you know, bacterial or anything that we need antibiotics for, but I think we need some. Can you swallow pills? Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. How, what's kind of steroid? Just the prednisone, just 5 days of prednisone. Oh, okay. Yeah. Which, okay, well he, so I, my understanding of if you have, I don't want to call it lung disease, even though my doctor told me I have cardiac disease, and I'm like, what if you have cardiac disease? Exactly. You know, it's like, what? If they have, like, this reactive airway hormone, they should be getting their vaccinations, right? Because if he gets the flu, wouldn't it just make this worse? Okay.

That's what I'm trying to tell my story. this. Absolutely. Okay. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah, I think so too. So he absolutely, I mean, it's totally okay to get the vaccines today. Yeah, I think. So I mean, we're recovering. Okay. We just need to recover, but it's totally fine to, you know, get the flu. Yeah. I mean, we could do the COVID. I have both. I know, I just, I just, you tell, I just go get one. Okay, I'll just go get them. Exactly. And I wish I, but I'm just going to say that they were recommended because of this. Yeah. That's. Because it's only going to make wheezing worse. And then. 100%. Yeah. And then for him. He's in swimming because he had gained some weight. Mm-hmm. So I don't feed him except for some of the after school, but I think he's swimming, he seems to be swimming. This woman I think is really good for him, so I hate to have him stop.

Oh no, keep swimming. We just need to, we need to fix the breathing. Keep the swimming. Swimming is awesome. So would you need to see him again? Yeah, let's see him after his birthday. But the last day is March. Oh, March. Oh, shit. I thought you were in July. Well, it's Emily. I'm like, we'll see you in March. That's why I was like, no, no, this is a perfect follow-up. Okay, so he, after Spartan, he was doing that sometime, and then his sister is also missing, but she, he's fine, she's got nothing, but she... What the doctor's saying is that you should come in like once a year just so she can see you and you can chart how you're growing and make sure everything's okay and I go every year. Yeah, you go every year? So yeah, this is, she's 5? She's 8. Okay, so I would, I saw her when she was 3. I've had a bit of it. Okay, so that's okay. So we'll get him scheduled to come back. Yeah. And we'll just get that scheduled to Kevin. I'll just tell Alex he's downtown. Their mother's in North Carolina. So he brought a letter, a note for me.

Great. Take care. over there. Work super. They're just vaccinated. They're glowing. Right, right, right. Let's do it. Okay, so two shots. Is it one shot or? No, it's two. It's two. Next year is combined, right? I hope so. Well, you know, kids are always the last ones for them to do anything for, so hopefully they do. It'd be very nice for it just to be combined. I thought I saw something that the CDC was saying it was going to, or like maybe the pharmacies are telling us that, next year. Exactly, I'm like, all those. All the studies aren't quick for combining anything. Okay. Well, it was wonderful to meet you. Yeah. I will see you in September. So that's like, that's a month, yeah, that's like five or six weeks. Yeah. Yeah, it'll be perfect. Okay. Perfect. And then obviously if we're not better. Okay. And then I guess I'll talk to Alex about bringing Emily in. Yeah. But if, well, she'll, her birthday's in January. I'll just tell her you wanted to come in and. Yeah. Well, I mean, she can, yeah, I mean, she can come in. For something. Or they can just do a shop visit just to get the, you know, just to get updated on the flu and COVID. And then we can see her for her checkup. In January? Yeah. Yeah. She's fine. Yeah. The thing is they both go to the dentist. Yeah. Right. Yep. Yep. It's only when it's a mask. Right? Right? It's okay. We'll get y'all squared away. Yeah, that'll be it. So we thought, okay, that's generic because...","[{'reasoning': ""Patient presents with chronic cough, wheezing, and exercise-induced dyspnea, consistent with asthma.

Yes, so my stomach stuff is doing much, much better. Yeah? Able to eat. i only ate bad once and i threw up right away oh what was bad um so we went camping with a bunch of friends and um somebody made scrambled eggs and i was like i can eat eggs you know well i didn't realize they had They made bacon too and they dumped all the bacon grease in the pan and then made the eggs. Oh, I gotcha. Yeah, yeah, that was way too much fat. And so then you vomited or you had diarrhea? I vomited. Okay. So the diarrhea stuff has been much better. Good. So, yeah, yeah.

So your MRI shows no dilated duct, no leak from your gallbladder. Okay. No stone in your biliary system. Mm-hmm. And your pancreas was normal. So. Okay. Everything in that is normal. Okay. Your stomach is your stomach, and so that's not meaning your gallbladder, but your stomach where you digest or grind up food. Uh-huh. You still have gastritis, ulcer, etc., etc. Okay. You're a lot better, and you wonder if maybe alcohol played a big role in that. what was going on for a while. Yeah, yeah. I don't know if that's true or not, but I encourage you to reduce consumption or, you know. Okay, yep, I still haven't been drinking, so. And then, you know, fat is always a problem for anyone that has a gallbladder. Yes, yeah, I think fat was the huge, huge thing too.

So you'll just have to get your own, because it's all to what you can. Mm-hmm. What you can't. Yeah, I think so far, I think it's been working pretty good. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Cheese and crackers you can do, but you can't do this. I kind of avoided cheese. I just gradually introduced cheese a little bit, but yeah, I was kind of avoiding that. Her target is like 10 grams of fat during a- Mm-hmm. And as long as she stays very close to there, but she's doing like, I can't describe how much better she's doing, like it's night and day. All right, good, good. Yeah. So, you know, the good news of that is that your biliary system looks good, your pancreas looks good. Okay. So, I mean, that... That's kind of off the table now. Okay, alrighty.

One thing when we're talking about fat that I was going to ask you about, I haven't done a lot of research on it. Can I eat like avocado? I know it has a lot of fat, but they say it's good fat or whatever. I don't know if your stomach distinguishes between... Good or bad or? So there is unsaturated fat and saturated fat and it all needs to be incorporated into a particle to be transported. Okay. So I would think you can eat avocado, it's just a matter of. How much will you be able to eat? Okay. You'll just have to do your own test. Okay, yeah, just start with tiny little pieces or whatever. Oh, no, start with a quarter and see what happens. Okay. You know, there's fat in it, but it's not like you're having five pieces of bacon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. All righty. I mean, I have many patients that, you know, my wife had a gallbladder on, you know, she can eat steak, but she can't eat steak and a baked potato with all the... cheese and butter on it. Ah, gotcha, okay. You know, at once, but she can certainly have a hamburger, just she can't have a hamburger and fries and cheese. Yeah, yeah, okay, gotcha, gotcha.

All right, and then I had some medication questions for you. So you have put me on the pantoprazole for in the morning and at night, and you said like to try it for a month? Well, it's been doing really good. I don't know if I should still keep doing that in the mornings, or do you want me to switch back to Pepsi? Well, I would like you to do Protonix once a day, now if you can. What's that, the Panto? Pantoprazole. Okay, alright. And that would be 40 milligrams in the morning on an empty stomach. Okay, alright. Pepcid, if you do Pepcid, it would be at bedtime. If you need it. Okay. And with your reduction in alcohol, you might not need as much. Okay. If you were doing well on one a day, you could do it intermittently. Okay, gotcha.

Let's see, in the morning, okay. And then I went to go refill my Asmonex and The pharmacy said that you said that I wasn't taking it anymore and like not to refill it. I don't know. Can you put that back in? Because I do still use my Asmonex. So if it's in there and you tell the nurse and she checks in that you're not taking it anymore, then they make a little mark and then it goes away. Oh, okay. So that's. or or um it could have been when i was sick and i said i wasn't using it it was giving you you're using it for a year the prescription expired and then it just disappeared Yeah, it still had two refills, but I don't know why. But I bet it was because you were not... When I was sick, and so I was like, no, I haven't been using that, yeah. There used to be... Just a one-way thing, we get prescription requests, but now the med list updates the pharmacy's computer. Oh, it does. Oh, okay. I did not know that. Yeah, that's probably what it was, because they said it was in June. So where's the next camping trip?

We're going to Warm Lake, not next week, but the week after. Oh, cool. Yeah. Well, I looked at the fire map today, it looks like Redfish Lake. Oh, yeah, that looks pretty bad, yeah, yep. That would be a sad thing. Yeah. The food guy said that they're probably closing the, closing it for the year. Oh yeah, I imagine because yeah it's getting towards the end of the summer kind of when they start. Well they lost all their stuff. Oh yeah, yeah, yep. Take a few days to get the kitchen ready to go and, you know, clean it out, and then, I don't know, seems like a month would be enough, but maybe not.

Alright, so that's going to go to St. Luke's Meridian? Yes. Alright. So I've got some leg issues, so I went and saw Dr. Adams, when was it, Tuesday, I don't know. He still just says that he doesn't really know what's going on like with my legs and stuff. So a few things about my legs. So my toes, I still have to take the gabapentin because they really start acting up like at night, like tingling and causing me grief. My left ankle keeps swelling. In the morning it's not as bad, but by the evening it's getting like really big. And so I was talking to him about that and he said I should talk to you about that because I asked him like, should I try like a leg compression sock thing or? I'm not really sure, or just leave it alone, I'm not really sure it's been going on. Well, I think at the end of the day, if you're up on your feet all day, as active as you are, that you're going to have swelling, and so a compression stocking would be helpful if you can do it. Okay, all right. Now, the question is, can you do it? Because it's 100 degrees out. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're hard to put on, they're not comfortable, they're not really nice looking, etc., but it could help. Okay. Typically in the morning it goes away? Yeah, it's lower in the morning, yeah. And do you notice that when it's more swollen you have more discomfort? Yes, yeah. So keeping the swelling out would be beneficial. Okay, alright.

So the... Compression suckings go from 15 to 20. 10 millimeters of mercury, 20 to 30, and then 30 to 40. Okay. 30 to 40 ones are the ones that doctors write a prescription for and you have to get fitted to do. Oh, okay. And they're gut-awful to put on and wear, and they're not pleasant. Okay. On Amazon, you can find 2030s that just look like a dress sock. Oh, okay. And they're easier to put on, et cetera, et cetera, so you could start with that and see if that's enough. Okay. All right, compression sock. Okay, and then, so you gave me that arm cream that I was using and I don't remember what that's called. I've been using it a couple of times a day. It was a refill from... my, what do you call it, Day to West dermatology from the dermatologist, but it had expired.

Uh-huh. So I had a rash on my leg, so I keep using that, and it's kind of hit and miss, it'll kind of go away, but then it comes back, and it'll go away, and it comes back. So I'm not sure if I should keep using that, or if I should try something else. or what I should do about it. I don't remember what the cream was called. When did, uh, Kenalog cream? [inaudible] Yes, that's the one, yeah, yeah. So it's right here mostly, and it gets worse in the evenings for some reason, and it'll kind of spread around a little bit. I don't see a lot there. Like these little bumps. I don't think you should use that cream for those. No? Okay. You think those come, those bumps come and go? Um, these ones are consistent. I'll get a few others around my leg. But, yeah, sometimes they get worse, sometimes a little better. There's this ball, it's even hard to tell what they are for sure. Alright, well, the cream can thin your skin and cause damage, so if you use the cream regularly, you should use it for 7 days and then off for 7 to 10 days and then on for 7 and then off for- for sudden attack. Oh, okay.

You should not use it continuously. It's a steroid, so if you damage it. Okay. That doesn't really look like eczema, it's just a little bump. As you get older, you can get keratoses, like cerebriate keratoses. Uh-huh. They're just so tiny, it's hard to characterize them. Okay. So I would ignore them. Okay. All right. I will do that. And then, um, I don't, do you think these are varicose veins? These get worse at night too. Like all of this stuff gets like real red and splotchy. Well, you know, it has the potential to be varicose, um, but they're. Not that big around. This is a perforating vein. It's a varicose vein. You see how that? Yeah. And so compression stocking might help with that. Okay. Certainly, you know, as that goes more down, it does look like it's more, well, no, when you leave it down. Oh, down? Okay, gotcha. It looks like it's more full. You raise it up, it's not as bad. Compression stocking would help that and it would help it not get worse. Okay, all righty.

Can I like, so I was going to use the compression stock on my left leg. Can I try using the one at night or would it not do good, do any good at night? No, you should just do it on both. Do it on both? Okay, okay. All righty, and then. You buy those pairs, right? I don't know. I guess so. I have no idea. Then I have a mole on my leg that I was going to have you look at because it seems like it's getting darker. But I don't know if it's nothing or anything, that one. And I don't know, it was just a freckle. Doesn't look like anything? Okay, that's all of the leg stuff.

Let's see. Oh, and then Paul and I had talked about, do you think it would be beneficial to redo my blood work? to look to things improved or not, what's your opinion on that? So your last labs were done in the end of April. A couple things with that we were wondering about was the, it showed like inflammation. Yeah, that's probably not worth redoing. It's worth redoing your liver enzymes. Okay. And you probably need to redo your iron, but that's got to be a couple months out. Okay. I think I would wait another month. -before you did any more lab. Okay, alrighty.

I'll put the orders in. Okay. So do you still want to see me in a month? No? Okay. Just, I'll write it on my calendar just to go, like, in a month then? Yeah. Okay. So are you guys going to take a big across the country camping trip? No, we'd probably kill each other in our trailer. It's 24 feet, it's perfect for camping for a week and then go park it for three weeks. And I'm not super thrilled about it. I like a nice, if we go two, three, four hour drive at the tops, you know, and then chill out.

Mm-hmm. And, but I want to, I want to pay off for that drive. Like, I don't want to do that like- Every day. Yeah. Or a couple of days. And there's so much nice, there's so much neat stuff to see just around here. Yeah. As we get older and better at it, you know, other stuff, maybe. I'm going to get a sprinter band and... Yeah. Across Europe. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm a, well, I guess I'll just, I'm, I'm scared to drive in Europe. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it just, it just seems very, you know, I don't know. I'm not a very good driver, how's that? Well I think in Europe they're way different aggressive.

I would probably park on the outskirts and take a bus or a train in and, you know, back and forth. The 12 lane roundabout? Yeah, I don't. Like I don't even know what I would do. Yeah. How do they do that? Just go around and around until they make the change? Yeah, I guess. I don't know. You go and you tell us. I guess if you're working 30 hours a week, maybe you got time to go around in circles for a while. I don't know. Yeah. So I only had one other question for you whenever you're ready. Oh, I'm ready. Oh, you're ready. Okay. So my body was doing really, really good because I've been going to physical therapy a couple times a week and they're like, oh, your balance is way better. You're getting stronger. You're doing really good. And then last week I went to McCall. And I drove myself, oh my gosh, my body has been killing me, and the physical therapist said that it's normal, because you're like in this position, or you know, like that position, and drive in, and it's normal, they say, they see a lot of people come in that get real stiff and sore, and. whatever, and then Paul says my seat isn't in the right position, too, but I don't know if you have anything to say about that or not, but, yeah, just like my entire body still hasn't recovered 100%, but.

Well, I think. You're a person that used to be really, really active and now you probably haven't been active at all. Yeah, yeah. And you're going to have to kind of return to... conditioning program to get back to where you were. To get stronger? -learn all of that. Okay, that makes sense. So, start riding the stationary bike, get a rowing machine, do those types of things to get yourself back in shape. Okay. Go to the Y and do some water stuff.

Okay, you can buy it. Absolutely. All right. Okay? Yeah. And I think that's all I have. Did you have anything? Nope. Just, I don't know if you get happy people in your profession. I think, I'll speak for me if you can speak for yourself. We are ecstatic. Like just those couple of visits, it's made a huge difference. We're super happy. Good. Just so you know. yeah so no more primary health yeah yeah yeah thank you sir good to see you have a great day okay thanks you too good luck i would tell you the place to get the compression stockings is amazon okay Sean?","[{'reasoning': ""The patient has a 'continued diagnosis of gastritis' which implies a chronic nature.

3b69110a-7de7-4e08-aa7b-53de28d51923,6.0,year,male,SONC ESTABLISHED PATIENT,"F90.2 ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), combined type","[inaudible] 6-year-old male, he impronouns here with mother for ADHD follow-up. Last visit was 3 months ago. Patient on Concerta, 36 milligrams daily. Last visit was tolerating well. Previously was attending Harmony Counseling Center every other week.

Hello. Hi. How are you, mister? Good. You're good? How was school? Good. Good? Does mom feel the same way?

No. No? I have updated assessment forms for you to. Okay. Perfect. So I have the or he goes to the rec center that he's in action, so I have that fill out one. Perfect. He's been having quite a few issues there. Okay. And then his teacher one as well. Oh, the teacher one looks good.

Yeah, it's been on my blood. Yeah. And what time does he go to kids in action? He goes there before school and after school. Okay. Are the major issues after school? The one that he got the other day was before school on a van. Another one, I want to say it was during like a full day that he was there. So it was on grades when he got back to school. Right. Does What time does he take his medicine? He takes it in the morning. Before you leave? Yeah.

Before, okay. So I would say about 6 o'clock. Okay. Are we still doing Harmony Counseling Center? No. They, his counselor just told me a couple weeks ago that he's moving to an iridium office, so we won't be using them anymore. Okay. So I need to see if we can try to figure out, I know referrals were sent in previously. Yeah. So I need a little bit to do that, because doing both of them at the same time, it can be a little bit difficult. Okay. So now that he's not going to be seeing a counselor, we're going to need to figure something else out.

Yes. I don't want to go to college. Let's see. So, because we had done integrity in March and Lifeways. [inaudible] behavioral health too. That was last year. Whichever ones are in Eldora? Those, all 3 of those are in Eldora, I think. They're in Eldora, and if we can get just, I guess, referrals to all of them, because I know some of them have wait lists. So yeah, so the rest of them, so those ones are all, pretty much all of them, because he's not Medicaid. they just, they don't require referrals. Okay. So, unless your insurance requires them, which for the most part they don't for this kind of stuff. Okay. So, those 3 are the ones that do kind of, the counseling plus can do medication management, so so if you don't want to do both, then it's kind of all nice to have in one.

Okay. The rest of the counseling offices, and I can give you the list again, would just be doing counseling for the most part, which is totally fine too. It's just the separate visits. Yeah, he would just, I think, be more in one of those places. Yeah, yeah. I think those are nice places because they do kind of like the psych They have psych NPs and things like that. I'll print this list off again and highlight a couple of them. Okay. And they're, I'm pretty sure they're all on there, but I'll double check. There's a couple new ones I found out about as well. Okay. There's another one. He's, I think he's old enough, but it's called the ADHD Center of Cascade. That is in Fairview though, but they do... they do kind of everything too, so I don't know if that's something that you're interested in, but they have a child psychologist there too, so that's kind of nice. So I could put in a referral to them.

Zebra. Yep. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel, stop please. Why? Because I said. Why Rachel? I told you to stop. Rachel. And the ADHD Center of Cascade also has a like, I think it's like a 90 day course, it's kind of like Overall, like parenting and all of it. And so some insurances will cover it too, so you can ask about that one. Okay. But I'll give you this list again. There's several, let me see if, well, okay. my ear looks like. -some body, some body. I'm adding a couple other ones on here that weren't on the list, but I've heard about recently that are pretty good too, so. But with the behavior kind of stuff, how do you feel at home, like when things are wearing off? [inaudible] Not very good. Okay. It's a little bit better. I need you to stop, please.

Remember our rule? What's our rule? What? How do you get a prize? I get a prize. What was the other thing? You're close. You're getting warmer. I know you know it. I know you know the rule. Oh, no, you're getting colder. Warmer. You're not there yet, though. What's the rule? Well, no.

No, not yet. I am. No, you're not all the way up there. And then what? What's the next part of the rule? Nope, that's not it. You're getting there. Now you just got to stay there. Remember? Stay there? Yeah, you just got to stay there. It's hard. I know it's hard, but we'll be fast, okay? I just got to get these phone numbers for your mom. And then we're all done? Well, not quite yet. So there is an option, a couple different options I think we've talked about before, of adding an additional 5 milligrams or 10 milligrams in the afternoon of the immediate release. or adding like a non-stimulant like guanfacine at night that should kind of help regulate throughout the day as well. Okay. So it's depending on how he's doing like with sleep and things like that, if he's already having a hard time with sleep then I don't love adding an additional stimulant during the day. So. He doesn't have that amount of issues sleeping, so we're pretty good on a set schedule with that. Okay. So I think if we can try doing the one at night and then that'll help him during the day. So it's just, it makes it a little bit difficult when he has to add in the afternoon just because I have to be the one to take to school, I have to be the one who does the refills and like make sure that he has enough at home and stuff too.

Okay. And so it's just a little bit difficult. Okay, yeah, we can definitely try it. There's also additional options to change to a different, like, different stimulant like Vyvanse or something like that, but let's try this first. Yeah, okay. Because it's the easiest overall to change and less side effects. The different classes of the stimulants can have their own side effects and things like that. Vyvanse tends to be a little bit more with like aggression and things on some kids. But we never know until we try, so that's where the. That's what his issue is with mostly, especially direct center, it's just regression. Okay. I've tried talking to them and trying to explain what's going on, and I think a lot of their counselors are under 18, is what she said, and so they don't know how to deal with it. Yeah. At school, it's more the defiant issues, so he just [inaudible] listening and doing schoolwork and things like that, so. Okay. I think it just varies on where he's at.

Okay. Paper. I need you to stop, pick that up and [inaudible]. Mm-hmm. I'm not going to give you a price. What? My name's Rachel. No, the hole, right away. Right there in front of you. It's a hole. Right there on his helmet. Throw it away. I've given you options. I'm doing well. Okay. So let's try that. And it's a pretty small dose, but it is an extended release similarly, but you do it at night, so then it should last through the day. It can sometimes help with sleep. And then we'll want to follow up just because it can lower blood pressure. It's actually originated as a blood pressure medication that they found was helpful with behaviors.

So we'll want to follow up with that. Stop it, now. Paper. No, stop. And do you want to get that at GroceryMart? Yeah. Okay. GroceryMart? What GroceryMart? What's GroceryMart? Dunklin'. BigMarket. Stop. I want a prize. Yes. No, you're not listening. I get a prize. No, you don't. I want a prize. You got to choose to listen to get a prize.

Okay. And then how is his appetite then? It's been, okay, it kind of goes up and down. So he is fine some days, and then some days he gets a little bit fuller than, sooner than he normally does. I'm just tired. Yeah. His weight has been stable throughout. I did not mean to knock on the door. Hi. Oh, I just wanted to know, you did not mean to? Okay. So his weight, he hasn't gained or lost, which is okay, but obviously we want to continue with some weight gain because he hasn't gained a ton of height either, so, because BMI is maintaining kind of stable in the 80s. but we want to make sure that he's not dropping. Yeah. So just making sure that what he does eat is good healthy proteins and those good healthy fats and things like that to maintain all of that. Is he doing vitamins? Yeah. It's hard. Yeah. To take them regularly, but yeah.

Okay. And then like the magnesium and things like that, is he doing those still? Yeah. Is he doing the magnesium pretty regularly? I feel like every day. Okay. So I need to do it regularly. Because that one, the magnesium especially, the more consistently you do it, the better it works. So if that's the only one you can get done every day with his pills, because now that you're going to do the guanfacine at night, you could do those together. Okay. And that might help remind you. Yeah, for sure. And then, you know, you could do the multivitamin in the morning with the other one or something like that, but. And then omegas, omega-3s can be also beneficial. Those ones you could do like 2 or 3 times a week can still be. Okay. Because most people don't eat fish every day, so it's kind of like, we always recommend like 2 or 3 servings of fish a week, so if you do 2 or 3 times a week with the omega-3s, that's better than nothing. Okay. So, let's see, and then I think. We gave you the questionnaires on the tablet right now.

There it is, okay. All right, let me listen to you. You got to sit up for it. Oh my goodness, so hard. Go straight. More big breath. Regular breath. - Still breathing. - Yeah. - Tyga just breathed. I don't know, okay. All right, so let's get that figured out. Let me get that paper. Probably want to see him in like 6 weeks to split it a little bit just to check on growth and blood pressure and everything. Blood pressure. And I think that puts us right around one of the holidays. Are we done? One of the school holidays, so. Are we done? Almost.

Oops. So that does put us on September 20th, which I think is like Martin Luther King Day. Okay. I'll probably have to call in because he is supposed to be getting vaccinations today. Okay. because he can't get them today, so. Did he, did we schedule him? Okay. [inaudible] I said he's, because he's not an established pediatrician, but they didn't tell me that, when I told them to schedule it. Yeah, they shouldn't have scheduled it at all. Let me see. I need you to be quiet, please stop. But he has a pediatrician? No, he doesn't have like a set one, because he hasn't really needed one. Okay, Douglin has. Why don't I need my pills? Oh, he is established, because we saw him. Right, that's what I said. Okay. Okay.

So technically, he is established here. He just hasn't had his well child, which he does need. Okay. They kind of did one of... Or, he had a physical, so I mean, he had that recently, but that wasn't, and it wasn't here. Yeah, it's a little different, but he does need, he does need a well child, but, okay. Yeah, they were telling me he was going to get established, but I did see him. So. So can we still get those today? Well, let me see if we have the records. That's the biggest thing is making sure we know what he's gotten in the past. What? What the heck? Did you see my school? And would the last time he got any be around 2016, it looks like? Like 7? Yeah, so he was at 6. Let me have her double check in the state system, because I think if the cell checks out, that would make sense for his 11-year pokes. So it would most likely be the tetanus booster and then a meningitis. Those are the required ones for school. And then, do you want the flu?

Probably not. Okay. And then he's also eligible for the HPV. Yeah. You want to do that one? So that one's a two dose series, one now and then one in six months to a year. Okay. So essentially, if you get this one, then the next one can be done any time before like 16, but, okay, so let me have her double check that and then I'll put these in. And then he would be due again for the meningitis booster at 16. Okay. And then he's on the Green Shield as well? Yes. Okay. Sprite. Right? Crossroads. Okay. Are you still thinking? Got to wipe the chicken crossword. All right, let me go double check that with the state. Are there any pies? And then he should be fine. And pies? I don't know, your mom said no. Not today. So unless you change some behaviors before brother's done, I don't know. Brother's probably going to get one for getting his shots, so. All right, let me go double check that and we'll get him checked in and do that because I think they probably need you to sign stuff on that. So I'll have her do that and then I'll get the papers for him while they figure that part out. Okay. He is established. He saw me. For an urgent care visit. And that still counts? I literally asked her, is he, is his PCP at St. Andrews? And she said yes. But he doesn't actually have one, he has a. Any of the minutes. That's fine. I have to get papers for them anyways, and I'll go double check Chloe. She's annoying because I specifically repressed. I know. She's not- Excuse me, this is Dr. Cole, I've been hoping to see you on Friday, I see you look fine right here. I was just calling to touch base on how you were feeling, but the swab came back negative, so how has your symptoms been? So the burning has gotten better. Perfect, okay, are you having any residual or new symptoms? Okay, good. So I think we can continue the plan that we previously discussed then, and that, that Pap smear may take a few weeks to get back, but I know the HPV testing was negative, so that was reassuring too. The garring [inaudible] testing was negative too, we just got that back, so. I think we continue the plan that we previously discussed for the service of Linda, and I said you have the ultrasound to help us take the study tomorrow, so I will follow up on that too. You're welcome, okay, you're welcome, okay, we'll give you. Well, literally. You're running Helen right now, have you been saw Katie? Not yet. [inaudible] What? I'm trying to follow along with my thoughts. Oh, you're doing it, hey. Hold on, hold, hold. Hey, [inaudible]. Where's your pain heart? Over here. Mm-hmm. [Inaudible] Where'd you get, where'd you put it? [inaudible] room. Mm-hmm. What was the last part? What was the last part? Oh, drink. So you're like, all right, if I have a name after the street that your [inaudible] Keep an eye on it, I guess, on [inaudible]. I know, I know. [Inaudible] They're going to open the door when they're gone. Okay, cool. Sweet. It's because it was a nurse visit, not a provider visit. Yeah. So I wasn't going to change the thing because there's nothing to put on it. Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Sometimes it makes sense. [Inaudible] HPV [inaudible] and. HPV? What? What? HPV Tdap from an [inaudible] Yeah, I was going to double check on Iris, but yes. I think he still has to actually be checked in. Come on, the other one we've won? Huh? What? I think the 12-year-old still has to be checked in. He won't be checked in. Is he? It says waiting. Yeah, but I don't think the actual appointment is checked in, it just said arrived, and then I put the order in. Oh yeah, it's not checked in. What about the other one? Logan needs nothing. Thank you. She didn't have an easy being there, but she's safe. I guess they've seen Theresa before, but I don't know what happened. I just, I made an executive decision that Noah Bennett's not pleased with. But he technically did his step. Like he, in the past, saw me as an urgent care visit. So in our past history, that means he's established. Did you do [inaudible]. Evelyn? No, I was talking about her. I don't know anything about her. I don't know her. I don't remember. I'm sure I do know her. Do we need to get Mason on the teletext? I don't remember seeing him. Huh? Do we need to get Mason on the teletext? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Look at me. I did do that. But then she's seen Dr. Harris since then, that's not cool, or no, maybe that's just a telephone call. What do I do? What do I do for a 10-year-old to feel [inaudible]. Depends on what happened, but I would just get an x-ray. And you got to get an vaccine if that vaccine is lost. [Inaudible] broken, but you can't do that today. Boom, clean. I think they're like just [inaudible] in the sinking ship. They're actually using a couple of the- [Foreign] So I took her kid. Are you kidding me? Because they were siblings that none of us noticed. And so she goes, well, I could go in first. I'm like, why would I do that to the kid? Why? I'm like, I'll see. And she goes, are you sure? And I'm like. That's really frustrating. Well, it's reasonable to not be. when everyone else is making arrangements for everyone else, like. Yeah. Like if, like on Friday, I'm pretty sure if it had just been him and the 2 of them, they probably would have seen all those kids. Made it work. And they would have been fine. Yeah. Hello. Yeah, I'm getting ready to be done. Yeah, it's fine. Okay. you burnt yourself on his coffee? I'm going to finish up these 2 notes before you get here. Okay. Bye. Had what? Yeah, he's annoying. It was just an executive decision of, easier to just get it done. Because technically, they scheduled him, like, some, like, they scheduled him before today, is what she said. I didn't have a chance to confirm that, but. Hmm. Yeah. Have you watched Wicked yet? Watched what? Wicked. No. There's a part that. if you had, would be hilarious right now. There's a part in there that would be hilarious right now if you had watched it, because she's basically like, something's wrong, I didn't get my way. And then they like pick her up and carry her out, because she's.","[{'reasoning': ""The patient presents with symptoms characteristic of both inattention (poor listening, difficulty with schoolwork) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (aggression, defiant behavior, frequent interruptions, not listening during visit).

L72.0 Inclusion cyst","Logan is a two-year-old girl who is here for her two-year well check. Use pronouns she, her. Yeah, I'm like, whoa. Good morning. Hi. How's Miss Logan? Ducky. I got a ducky today. Say hi. How are you, girl? Are you two? Is that mommy's keys? She's like, yeah. Don't worry about it.

What are you doing? Um. Oh, this is the only one that doesn't have a body. OK. She's got this little thing forever. Is that a wart? That's a great question. It's not a wart. It looks like a little inclusion cyst. Is that a little white spot? Yeah. So sometimes our body will just kind of, like, capture a portion of skin cells. And, like, just decide that it's going to keep them there. And so, first of all, if it's not bugging her, because clearly it's not, sometimes, like, dermatology will prescribe retinoids to the area, which thins the outer layer of skin, and so it kind of opens, but irritates the skin. No, I don't want anything that irritates your skin. Right. What will happen, it will probably, like, rub one day or something. It'll just, like, open and go away. If it becomes inflamed looking, just come see me, and I can take a peek at it. That's cool. But, yeah, it's either an inclusion cyst, or it's becoming what's called an epidermoid.

No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. OK. That's the sound I make when I'm having a crazy day. Toilet training.

No. Um. At daycare, they have set times. They go, they pull their papers off. Uh-huh. But at home, it's like, it's no. Will she go at daycare? No, she's only once, and they've been trying for a long time. She's not ready. OK. Is that kind of how you're feeling? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's young. She did it herself. Like, she just got pain in her pants at night. Yeah. OK. How old was she? Probably closer to three more. Yeah. OK. That's been my experience now. Like, personal experience, I have seen kids like that get it, like, even before two. It has nothing to do with parents. OK. I feel like when they're ready, they're ready. It's just one of those things that, like, yeah, you can argue against reality. You're just going to lose, you know? Uh-huh. So if it were my kid, I'd be like, have fun at daycare. Like, it sounds more like the daycare is trained to not care. OK. And, like, when she's ready, you're going to know, just like you did with him. OK. You know?

Yeah. So I think a lot of my job, I tell people, is just reinforcing that intuition you already have. OK. Yeah. How about limit setting and behavior kind of stuff? So, I think, I don't know if it, maybe it's just the two of them. Maybe? But, like, they get in fights. Oh, yeah. They full on hit each other. Uh-huh. And, like, I'm amazing. I don't want to yell all day. And I don't want to be that yelling mom. 100%. But you also don't want to be passive. And so you're probably trying to figure out, I don't want this. But if not this, what? Well, I have emotional.

Oh, of course. I've got, like, pneumonia or whatever they had. And my mom mentioned. Ah. So it was bad for the poor babies. No. But that. Can I say it? No, but of course you can. No. So, you're ridiculously sick. You're on, I have tissues for just in case. You're on antibiotics because you're so sick. You're not sleeping. You have three kids, two of which are not even a year apart in their birthdays. Yeah. I mean, the fact that you don't cry every time you're in here is a miracle. And I feel like I'm losing my shit all the time. Oh, I feel like you're a human. Of course you feel like you're losing your shit. Right? Yeah. So, just first of all, taking a minute to be like, okay, so this is hard because it's hard, not because you're doing it wrong. Okay?

So, it's the first and a lot of grace for you. Because, girl, my kids, I have a much bigger gap. And the days that I go to bed and I'm like, okay, so do I help pay for their therapy? Like, should I start, I have a college fund, should I start a therapy fund for my children? I get it. Now... Oh, poor thing. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry for me. I'm sorry. Take a minute. So, I have to say, I'm very thin-skinned. Oh, of course you have. And I don't, I don't, I guess, know how to discipline my kids. Yeah, so let me get you resources that have helped me. And why I love this, yeah, you go for it, girl, is, um... I don't know if we've talked about Dr. Casey, but do you ever have minutes to listen to podcasts? It'll make you feel less alone. I could find time.

Do you have, like, earphones? That might be... Do you have AirPods that go on, like, noise cancellation? I don't have the newer ones, though. Okay, which is totally fine. But I just didn't know, like... Quiet. This is obviously Rachel. This is another big lesson in losing your ever-loving minds in the back of the van. And I will be like... And put them on noise cancellation. And breathe. Like, I can still hear enough that I can hear sirens. Because I'm, like... I feel like I've got... They're escalated. If I match, it just explodes. And no one can see. But, like... You have to have this, like... Satan-y level. I'm just gonna put this one out of your way. I mean, you know. I don't know what the problem is here. I love her stuff.

So, with Dr. Casey... One of the biggest things I learned, first of all... Is that if you learn nothing else as a parent, it's repair. And that's the single thing I do the most with my kids. Is, yeah, I lose my shit. And I go to them, and, like... I put myself in the bathroom. Max in the corner. And then I come out, and I'm like... That was in the bathroom. I'm sorry. I'm having a hard time. And I think if we get good at anything, it's that. When it comes to fights, she has a lot of... A lot of really good things. You want to go up there and do your checkup? Okay, let me show mommy this kind of stuff. This would probably be one of the best ones for you. I'm serious, if you like just, do you have podcasts on your phone? This is the one you get, I'm serious. And the goal, yeah, there is some stuff on like, she has a lot of really good tips. Like for sibling fights and things, she talks about like being the observer and saying things out loud without getting involved. Like I see two girls having a really hard time, right? And then if it's hitting, it's like, okay, that's not allowed now. Your hardest part with it is both of your younger girls are at the age that it's not like, like if you're taking one to help them like regroup, with the other one, right? Like, I just can't even say, first of all, you're doing better than you think. I want you to hear that because we all feel like we're failing. And you know, the ones that are, the ones that don't feel like they're failing, they're, cause they don't care, right?

So the very fact that you even are like dying from pneumonia and you're concerned isn't even you, like that is such a mom thing. You're like, I am so sorry, I'm like, and I'm like, I'm yelling at my kids. But I'm like, you're not okay, right? I'm like, that's a, it's like, you're not, there's no way you could be okay. No sane person would be okay, all right? So I would say like, okay, so some days are just about survival. Just get to the end of the day. If everyone's fed and you get them into bed time, which is my favorite time of the day, just like that's right now, we are not trying to thrive, just go through survival, okay? And then when this freaking season is a little bit better, then we'll work on it. You don't even have the reserve to learn new parenting. You don't, you don't, right? Most of us were raised with being left alone and sick. And we know we don't want to do that, but we also don't want to raise our kids. And we don't really know how to do that, right? And so it's like, we don't want them to trot all over us, but we don't want to hit them and yell at them. So like, what do we do? And what I know is like, right now you just survive. Get through like healing, try to get some sleep. If sleep's not a problem, that's what I know. My life falls apart. And it's hilarious to say to a mom with kids the ages you have to get sleep. She sleeps with me still. Good. The baby's doing great. Awesome. She sleeps with me. No, our goal is survival. She's alive. You're somehow still alive. That's awesome, right?

Making it, right? I mean, seriously, the only tip I want you to take from this aside from if you have any minutes to listen to that you don't feel so alone is repair. Just practice. Okay? Really. How many times did your parents apologize to you? 30. Let's just start there. Right? Little things. Mama lost it. That wasn't about you. I'm sorry. I love you. That's all. We're just going to work on that.

She's 28 pounds. A lot. Uh-huh. She's like perfectly following her curve. 60th percentile. Look at you, big girl. She's three feet tall. 92nd percentile. Your daughter's grown beautifully. Her development is ridiculously gorgeous. Your kids, they're resilient. They're going to be fine. You deserve to like it. You deserve so much.

How is your husband doing? He's the problem. Uh-huh. But I've used that the whole time. His anxiety, which he may not label it that, shows up very typically for a man. Like more anger due to lack of ability to control. Yeah. And I've felt that since, like, well, since he told me when I was pregnullt. Uh-huh. When Logan was a baby. Yeah. I could just see it and I was like... He's very absent. Yeah, that's his coping. He just gets away. Uh-huh. Thank you. Who else do you have? His mom. Is she helpful? She's very unhealthy. Okay. Like emotionally? Both. Okay. Look at you, honey. She can help a man. Right? I mean, that's my mother-in-law. I'm like, well, you raised my husband, who I love, but has had to do a lot of work.

Here. Do you want to touch this one? You're safe. See? There's no owies. It's little tickles. That's why I look for bunnies in your ears. Uh-huh. You can hold Mommy's hand. Would you feel safer? Yeah. You're safe. She speaks in full sentences. She's the smartest little toddler. So her... I totally agree with you. Her speech... Just didn't, like... I mean, she's about two years ahead in terms of speech. Really? Yeah. I remember Emmy didn't talk till she was like three. She just didn't want to. Different kids, right? And now she's fine. Woo-hoo! Open up your mouth, baby. Ah! Can you do it? You see? Show the teeth.

What's in there? Show me. Ah! Oh, there's a tongue. How long's your tongue? Are there bunnies in the back? Good job. I know something that... You don't like that, do you? Are we silly? I know something doesn't feel good about that. I know. Almost. Almost. I listen. So we're gonna go... You're safe. Right? Right? Remember my drum? Wanna touch? Yeah. Oh, and the belly. Can you help me put it here? Help me hold it. Yay! Let's put it here. Can you help me?

Yay! Can you take a big breath? Ah! Who is that? Am I touching your arm? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I know. Is it cold? Yeah. Yeah. You don't love it.

Can we feel your belly? Yeah. Do you wanna lay down? Oh my goodness. Do you wanna lay down? Do you want your head here or here? Lay here. Okay! Go ahead! You gotta lay all the way down. Look at my monkeys. See my hands? They feel cold. Cold? Uh-huh. So it's going to be cold on your belly. Good job! Wah wah. Is that a ducky? Can I duck that? Yeah, you got some poo-poo to come out today, huh? There's a little poo-poo in there. Would you sit under your diaper? You're safe. Are you safe? You're safe, even if you feel scared.

Normal! I know. That's your vulva, and I make sure it's healthy, too. Good job! Is Mama there? Your Mama, she gets hugs, huh? We love our Mama. Mommy! Mommy! You've been playing outside, girlfriend. You want to help come in, Mama? Mama, big hugs. You say, Mama, you're doing a good job. Yeah. Thank you. Your Mama's doing a good job. Mama needs to hear that, because we don't feel like we do a good job. Good job, Mama! You really are. She's not going to remember. She's not. She's going to remember the feeling of love and feeling comfort. That's what she's going to remember. This is hard for you.

Yeah, you're going to get through this, girl. You send me messages, anything you need. I'm serious. Thank you. It does for community-acquired pneumonia. I only asked him this morning if he threw up mucus. Oh, gosh. Just draining in the back of her throat? She sounds clear. Not her, but Jamie. Oh, you're talking about Jamie. Sorry. I know. When did we start a mock interview? Let me look. Well, she didn't start. I never brought her in. I only brought Logan in. Okay. And I started thinking... Mama! Yeah. Oh, right. So I didn't... She only has a lingering cough, but she seems to be doing a lot better. She seems to be doing better? Let's just leave it as the mucus is probably... Probably, but one thing that you could do, if it's worth the fight, is, like, the saving spray to try and rinse out her mucus membranes before bedtime.

Okay. Especially with all the stuff in the air. It's not that she's allergic to it, but when we get inflamed, like, all that gets in there and physically just, like, causes mucus. So you could do that, like, before bed just to kind of, like, try and clear her out. Okay. But... She's getting to make the next week, anyway. Oh, good. I can look. It looks like she's with me two weeks. Exactly two weeks on a Tuesday. Okay. But if you worry about her one or seen before then, you just let us know, okay? It may not look like it's there on my chart. Okay. You can call, so I'll figure out a way to get her seen if you just want her, like, listened to. Okay. You know, just, like, make sure it's okay. But if you're like, no, overall, you think she's doing well, and it's just that she, like, woke up and puked all this mucus, then as long as it's just, like, first thing in the morning from all the drainage. Okay. Okay? Oh, gosh. We're all going to come through a lot. This is a hard one for you. It's not. I can tell. Thank you for sharing with me. No, thank you for listening. Yeah. I get it. You're doing a good job. You really are. I hate it. Huh. Can you say thank you? Thank you! You're welcome, Logan. We just keep telling mama, good job, mama, okay? She's so funny listening to the words that come out of a little person. Amen. She copies. It just keeps going, too. My seven-year-old was like, I don't know, mom, I don't get sick that often, so you know what I decided? And I go, what? This was yesterday. And she's like, I must be a leprechaun. And I was like, yeah, that checks out. Alright. Like, I don't even know where that came from, but I love kids. She's a leprechaun. They don't get sick. Right? Oh, you get an hour and a half. My kids are just sick for, you know, six months of daycare. And then it was like, now she doesn't remember because she's never sick. And I'm like, oh, you were. And I cried. Oh, buddy. You're welcome. Not excited to see us today. Good morning. Good morning. You're so cute. I really do. I feel like that is just, like, your style. I went back to it, finally. Yeah. Felt like coming home. Every time I see you. And it's funny because my sister just texted me this morning. She's like, guys, I love you. Has she ever had them?

46b084d1-b2b4-4000-a81b-c408725170a0,82.0,year,male,ESTABLISHED PATIENT,I48.0 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"Okay, sorry. So this looks normal. Your heart's a little on the slow side because it's in the 50s. Do you ever get lightheaded or dizzy when you're doing things? Oh no. Okay. And you're not, the medicines that she put in the computer, those are the only ones you're taking? There's not any, you're not on any beta blockers like metoprolol or? I already take that. Carvedilol or anything, oh you're on metoprolol, there it is. Yeah.

Okay, so I'm just going to give you a little bit about AFib. So AFib means the top part of the heart doesn't squeeze normally. The top part collects the blood, pumps it to the bottom, and the bottom part squeezes to pump it out to the rest of the body. And so fibrillating means that top part, instead of squeezing normally, just shakes real fast. And when it does that, the bottom part gets confused, doesn't know when it's supposed to squeeze, so you get kind of an irregular heartbeat. So it's usually fast and irregular. So instead of a boom, boom, boom, you get a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And so that's what's happened before. You've had it, I think you're in the... And 2 years ago you had some AFib and you were in the emergency department. Yeah. And so. Because that top part doesn't squeeze normal, it just shakes. Blood can pool and get stagnullt and blood clots can form and those blood clots can break off and go to your brain and cause a stroke.

ulld so that's what the blood thinner is for, that warfarin. Warfarin. That one you have to have your blood drawn. to check and make sure you're not too thin or. Right. And so that's why that Coumadin, it's a little inconvenient having to get your blood drawn all the time. But there's newer medicines. The new one that the VA covers is called Eliquis. It's a pill you take in the morning and at night, but it's just one dose. You don't have to get your blood drawn to check and see what dose it is so is that that's that kind of what they felt like that's what they said yes they just wanted me to make sure that it was an okay medicine for you to take and Okay. All right, and if we send it to the VA, they said they'd cover it, huh? That's what they said. Okay, so I will send it in. Then can you let Tom know so he can reorder when it needs reordering or do we just call you? I can reorder it. I put in for 3 months supply for a full year. Oh, okay. And so. So we'll take care of it. Okay. As long as the VA will pay for it and cover it for you, give it to you, that's fine. Okay. And so, when you get that, so...

When the new pills arrive, stop taking the warfarin, and then 2 days later, start the Eliquis. Okay, 2 days in between. Yep. They also mentioned- when he was talking to me about we should have a an extra week supply of that new medicine on hand all the time because I should never run out. Mm-hmm. So there's a time between when we ordered it and- We got a new batch, they should always have a one week. Just in case? Just in case, now that's what they've told us. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so that looks good, all right. Any questions for me? No, just whatever we. Yeah, this will just be, this will just be more convenient for you because you won't have to have your blood drawn and checked for it. Right.

ulld then we just keep an eye on it and see, right now you're in normal rhythm, you're not in AFib right now. And so, but that AFib can come back at any time, and so it just kind of depends on how it makes you feel, if you notice it, then we need to do something about it. Um, but if it, if it's not bothering you, then we can leave it alone too. No, what kind of bother? What are you talking about? So if you, so if you feel like your heart's racing, so going really fast. If it's irregular, so sometimes it doesn't go quite as fast, but it's like ba-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, and then sometimes you can fill it that way. Some people just notice they're more short of breath or more tired than normal. Well, but he's not an AFib right now. No, but he was short of breath. Does it come and go or is it that way all the time? Well. Comes and goes, a shorter breath. Yeah. Well, is it every time you get up and move around you're shorter breath, or is it, sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't? I don't know how to answer that. Well, if he goes outside, he can't hardly walk up the steps because he's out of breath. Okay. And that's pretty consistent. Yeah, and if he's up walking around, he'll sit down because I said, he said, I just can't catch my breath. Yeah. Okay. So it's kind of an ongoing. Ongoing thing, because the afib will come and go, and so if there's certain times where you're like, wow, I just feel way worse than normal, then that could be the afib causing it. Probably what that is. Do you have a- Do you have a blood pressure cuff or something at home? Yes. So if you're having a bad episode, check with your blood pressure cuff and see what's going on. They'll give you your blood pressure and also give you your heart rate. Your resting heart rate today is in the 50s. And so if you're sitting there resting and calm and your heart rate should be the 50s, 60s, even 70s maybe, but if you're resting, you've sat there for a few minutes and your heart rate's above 100, then it's probably the AFib. Okay. Okay, so that's one way you can tell at home. And then if it is, then give our office a call so we can help figure out what to do with it, okay? If it's making you feel bad and it's going real fast, then we can shock the heart to get it back to normal. As long as you're on a blood thinner so we're sure there's no blood clots in there, then we can shock you to get it back to normal. And so any of the ERs here in Rupert or Early can do that if we're in AFib, so that's one way to get rid of it. And so then if we're having more episodes, we may have to put you on some stronger medicine for it and things like that, but. Okay. That's one way to tell them if you're in the AFib. Okay. Okay?

All right, so I want to see you back in six months and kind of see how you're doing with it. Okay. But I think overall we're- We're in pretty good shape. Shaped as far as the heart's concerned. Good. Okay, let me grab some papers for you. We've got an appointment. So if you give us a call in November, then we can get you seen in January, okay? Thank you, doctor. You guys have a good day. [inaudible] [inaudible] Okay, that one is a little bit, a little bit more of the ear. Mm-hmm. That's good. Well, you know, Paul‚Äôs not by the time to get us in stage 29, so. Yeah, I see. They want to spare a call. Okay. Does the insurance say that they want to pay for it as many a year or a day? Are you planning to do one? It depends on what insurance they have. [inaudible] Exactly. Come here. Is everyone in the same space? Why wouldn't he be? I don't know. Chris told me to ask you. Oh my gosh. Casey was fine. You took Hayden to Miami. You took Hayden to Miami all day.

H65.01 Acute serous otitis media of right ear without rupture","Jordan, hi guys, I'm Dr. Johnson, have I met you before? Once. Once, okay. Just a big year plus ago, we thought he had red eye, but instead it was sunscreen in his eye. Oh, there you go. Big eye. Anyway, this one might be just as similarly, you know. We'll see, we'll see. I'm going to introduce him to my AI scribe because this is my secretary. So Jordan is spelled R-Y-L-E-Y. He's a six-year-old boy here with mom and dad for, is it ear pain?

Yes. Which ear is bothering you, kiddo? Point to this ear. The right ear. Okay, so when did symptoms start? Come up here, big guy. Come on. When do you think it all started? One week ago, he started general. He wasn't like really complaining. It was just like, oh, my ear sort of hurts a little bit. We went swimming and I think it's possible that he got some water in his ear. And then he didn't say anything, didn't say anything. And then just randomly two days ago, something like that, he was- Oh, his ear hurts. Again? Yeah. Nothing for a few days? Correct. And then two days ago. And then yesterday he didn't say anything, but then again he did today and so.

Is it that bad or just a little bit of it? But it's not polite to do in somebody's face, okay? Yeah. Is it that bad of an ear pain or just a little bit when it hurts? I don't know. I'll go with not that bad. Okay. He doesn't cry? No. Okay. Does it keep him awake at night or wakes him up at night? No. No. Okay. Does it stop him from playing? Can you stop anything from bleeding? Yes, but they're really in pain. Uh-huh. So he's had an ear infection once before and we did the same thing where it was like, well. I don't think it's really anything. And then we went and he had it. Okay. So I'm like, I'd prefer to just, his school starts next week. Okay. We'll be ready. We'll be ready. But no fever?

So he, oh, that was the other thing. He has had- over the last week, a low, like, 90. That's been 100. 90, yeah, nothing. But he's been really low energy, sleeping a lot more in the last week. And there are colds with this, or a cough. He's got runny nose. Okay, for a week. Stuffy nose. For 3 days? Yeah, well, so it was stuffy for 3 days and then it's only just started getting worse. And he gave it to me too because my... Okay, so the stuffy nose started a week ago and then it turned into a runny nose the last few days. Yes. Is there a cough with this? Uh, kinda. A little bit? Intermittent? Not very much. Not very much?

Yeah. Okay. Any sore throat? Uh, no. No. Any vomiting diarrhea? Do you know what diarrhea is, kiddo? Yes. What is it? Soft poop. Water poop. You're right. Smart boy. High five. Does your ear hurt right now? Uh, no. No. No, of course not. Okay. Did he take any medicine today? No. No. I did. Oh my goodness. I did, um. have it, um, a few minutes. Ago? Yeah, today, today. Today, sometime today he had some ear pain, okay. Let me check your eyes, I don't know what to make out of this, but okay, let's see. We'll just have to look at your ears, right? Look at my light.

Yep. Eyes are looking normal. Can we look up your mouth? Say ah. Tongue out. Good. No tonsils? Where are they? We haven't taken them out. You're so little that I can't see them. Good job. He just didn't grow them. No, no. They're hidden. No jostles for you. Yes. Look at your nose. Oh, he's got a little bit of clear nasal drainage. No problem. Let me feel your neck and no swollen cervical lymph nodes.

You ready for school? Excited? I'll be excited for you. Mm-mm. Yeah, I had your new teacher, Miss Bennett. Whoa, when did you meet your teacher? Uh... Thank you. Um, in, oh, um, I met her when I was in preschool. Oh, last- But did you, did you see her today? Yeah? Yes. Oh, okay, okay, all right, yes, heart sounds are normal, big breath in, out to go. Keep going. Big breath in. Out you go. And big breath in. Out you go. And one more. And out you go. Good job. Okay, I'm going to listen to your belly. Okay, let's lay down, okay? And we'll just check it out. No owie, don't worry. And you're eating normal? Yeah. This past week? Okay, just the energy's a little down. He hasn't been eating as much, no. No? Sorry for that. I wasn't thinking. Yeah, drinking, drinking and peeing. He's been trying not to drink very much, but he's also just not a good drinker. Oh, we got to work on this buddy, huh? Yeah. Ah, so that we don't get dehydrated and we can start feeling better with our colds as well. When we have colds, I usually recommend breasts and fluids, yeah, which is drinking a lot. And if you want to do a humidifier at bedtime, that would be helpful too, and maybe propping the head up a little bit, so our nasal drainage doesn't wake us up in the middle of the night from coughing, huh? And let me see this ear. Yeah, this ear looks great. So left lymphatic membrane clear. Here's the verdict. Here we go. Is there any something in there? Let's take a peek. So looking at it, it's so beautiful mama, so right tympanic membrane clear, there's no bulging, yes there is a little bit of clear fluid behind it, yes it can cause a little bit of discomfort, it is from the cold, which is okay. Okay, so will he let you do Flonase? Because that might help a little bit. Maybe. Yeah? Yeah, he might. Yeah. And I have some at home for myself, so we can try. Okay, so just make sure we don't spray it in the septum because it can make it bleed, so just spray it outside. Okay, yeah, so every night. Is that why mine always bleeds? Probably. You're not doing it correctly, lovey, okay? I wasn't supposed to know if there was anything on the package. It wasn't on the package, you're right, because we get that complaint all the time, we don't use it anymore because of nosebleeds. Okay, try it out, okay? All right, so just like spray this? All right. that way, yes, all right? That would be nice. Yes, so let's do that once a night, once per nostril, let's do it for one to two weeks or when the cold symptoms go away completely, okay?

Perfect. But yeah, so this is just clear fluid behind it, it likely will not get infected, but if it does spike a high temperature, like more than 100, or that your pain gets severe, where he's waking up at night, he's really crying, then let's take a look again at those ears, but right now it doesn't look like it. Okay. Okay? Thank you very much. Yeah, you're welcome. Peace of mind, right? That's exactly what it was. Okay, but if the cold symptoms get worse, where there's wheezing difficulties breathing, you want to see them back, okay? I think you'll be okay. That was a good cough. Thank you. He wants to. I did a horse day. Oh, what? With a cough. Oh my gosh. I think he is gone. He's even silly, huh? I know. Well, the last thing I wanted was on Monday to be like, we have to go to the doctor. Yay, we're missing school. No, thank you. No, no, we're not missing school, okay? You're going to be okay, but we'll rest this week and stay away from the smoke if it's smoky, okay? Okay.

All right, let's head home. Thank you so much. And you're welcome, and I hope Daddy feels better. Thank you for sharing. I feel fine, I just, I lost my voice. I can still hear you.

And I go, so what do you think about all this? He goes, sorry, I'm gonna say. He's like, Shanice, that's fine. And I'm like, yep. You're like, you said it, not me. I'm like, okay, you, okay. So who's dad? Elijah Grant and his siblings come to you too. Oh. Yes, yes. The Grant family.

I love that. Okay, here, because I'm like, I don't know. All I know is like, some part of that side of that. I'm gathering a little on the nuts. I don't know, Elijah, how old is he? He's 22. Yeah, that must be, but he would have been, because I've been practicing seven years. Why didn't he see me? Yes, I know. Which side is he? So, hold on. From what I understand, mom's total, his mom is nuts. And so I think you see, who's the mom that you see? I'm not doing this. Nope. I know, I'm like, I know them so well. Like, you guys are in the same level of families that I adore. Oh, you would get along with, have you ever met? I've never met any of them. So this, she's definitely not, or I'm crazy, Morgan. Yes. Okay. Is, hold on, dad's house, oh. Okay, Morgan is. No. Um. Yes. Is Morgan mom? Or is. No. There's, there's several dads involved.

Is this step, stepdad J. Ramirez with Morgan. Morgan's the mom, let me make sure that's the mom I talked to. Yeah, Morgan is not crazy. Okay. That's not the one. Okay, I think. Who is, but her last name's different. Ramirez is her last name. Okay. J. Ramirez. Okay. But her ex, Jordan. Yes. So, like, whoever Elijah calls his dad is really his stepdad. So, that must be J. I think so. I don't know. Mia's like, we're not having. Yeah, J must be because bio dad Jordan. Yes. Is kind of a jerk face. Okay. So, Mia's like, we're not having a baby shower because I don't. Don't they like? I wonder if they don't like the one I like. I don't know. Well, she's like. I'm so curious. So, she's like. Hudson like whatever, I'm just saying. She's like.

You guys have been talking. None of them get along. She goes, can you imagine if they were all in a baby shower? I'm like, don't let them control what you want and she's like, I don't want a baby shower. I can see Morgan being fine with it though. Okay. She's pretty like mature. Who lives with their mom? Is that Morgan? Who lives with their mom? Yeah, like the mom pays for everything and one of them's. I don't know where, I don't know Elijah. Drunk a lot. I thought that might have been Morgan. I know, that's why I like her. I don't know. Like, she wasn't working for like six months and mom was paying for everything. Wasn't working. I thought it was, I thought it was his real mom, which I think is Morgan. What are the names of the other, can you tell me, what's Elijah's brother's name? He's, he's, he just turned 18. Kayden? No. Oh, those are the littles. Well, Dexter, Kendry, Nolan. No, Tate, Brody? No. I don't take care of them. They have Kayden, Nolan, Dexter. That was, this is his I think it's Morgan because it says at dad's house it's just Dexter and Selena mom's house it's mom stepdad two stepbrothers and Selena the stepbrothers are Nolan and Kayden. Dude I'm just so I have weird webs between my family's right my mind's blown.

How's school? Boring. What grade are you in? 9th. Is that high school for you? Yeah. This is Elijah. This is his younger brother. Does he look familiar? I mean not the best picture. You have to show me. I'm in the picture. You just showed me. What's his brother's name? I don't know. Shaggy hair, sunglasses man. Shaggy baby. I don't know but I love like I love Morgan but I also love her as the pediatrician she listens. Well because she told Mia my mom told her I'm not babysitting because I'm not living my life. I think Morgan I feel like Morgan would be like over the moon excited. I think Morgan was Jordan's there's like they've all been married like three or four times. I believe that. Leila. Do you know Leila? Leila I think is. Leila what's the last name? Brooks. Gavin I'm so sorry 9th grade is high school. Yes and he's doing great. He does. Are you? Like are you though?

Like not your grades. How are you doing? Good. Are you sure? Yeah. High school was friggin hard. Well I'm not like it's not any I don't know if it's private or not but it's just a very small school. Yes. So there's not a lot of kids. I don't know her. Okay. She's young. She's she is she's a good one though. She's taking gonna do all the baby pictures. They do like her. She's married to Alex. Okay which I think is the ex. The ex. Morgan's ex. And they're being nice and then Morgan and Max not so nice. Dude. I can see Morgan saying that. I'm in the doctor's office. Okay. What do you like about school? Yes. Can I find you there? My friends mainly. Yeah. What do you guys like to do? Play basketball. Which is Spanish sports. I think good. A lot of other periods is well they're actually pretty laid back except for Spanish. Oh Spanish. Why? Why is that not laid back? The teacher?

No the teacher's the best. Morgan's the mom. Awesome. Definitely but the course is just very confusing. I guess you could say. I don't know. Morgan's mom. She's the one that they say is crazy. There you go. The one that I like. What does that say though? Um you've had great judgment thus far. I'm hearing. I always tell people I'm like this relationship though is like so different right than like meeting someone even at like softball game stuff and they're saying they're talking like you know. Yeah. But like in this role. It's very different. Yeah. So. I love Morgan's daughter. She's like a man. Okay. So I will give them a chance. Not that I wouldn't anyway. But. Yup. I'll see. I might be good friends. Well, that's, I'm like, I could see you and Morgan getting along like no one's business. Right. That's what I was gonna say. So, yeah, keep me updated. I'm excited to meet this little lap duck. Yeah. Yeah, hopefully it comes out okay. Her name's Calla. How are they spelling that? C-A-L-L-A-H, I think. Oh. They wanted a flower name. Her name... Like Calla Lily? Uh-huh. I know.

Actually, her name's gonna be Calla May. I'm like, Calamine Motion? Do they, like, do we get a vote? I didn't get a vote. Probably not. I tried. I really tried. I mean, as a pediatrician, I strongly recommend names that are more relatively common. Like, even at my daughter's, in short term, at my daughter's softball game, they were trying to spell one of the girls' names, which just felt silly, and none of them could. So it was a chant. You know the names are just... Oh, yeah. The chant, they, like, spell it. You know, Give me an L, da-na-na-na. And then they all kind of, like, drift off. They're like, how do you... I started dying. I was like, this is what new parents need to hear when they're thinking of what do we name our child. Right. Like, the other day, I told her, I go, Mia, all I can think of is Calamine Motion. Yes. Can we, can we please just agree that once you see her face, that you are open to changing? Just wait until you meet her. That's what I said to her, and she goes, okay. But Elijah is stuck on this, and I'm like, Nora June, because she won't choose June. Why are they Southern? Mia's going to name this June. Okay, I'll allow it. And they have an Aunt Rosie June. See, Rosie June is Southern. Yeah. Okay. And, yeah, I'm trying. So, Amber, my son's, they're naming her Bailey. I'm like, good. How are you spelling it? A-A-D? No. Because Amber is A-A-A. No, no. I'm like, oh my gosh. They just increased her lifetime risk of autism by 30%. And I wish I was joking. Oh, really? When they named, I'm not kidding. When they named my nephew Zane, and they spelt it J-A-X-X, I was like, do I get a vote? That's all I said. And my brother-in-law, it was just my brother-in-law. My sister-in-law is too soft to handle that. Right. And he was like, no. And I said, cool. I'm excited to meet Zane. I know. Like, I hired this kid. His name is Ewan. A-A-V-E-N. And I keep calling him Ewan. Like, we don't know, A-V-A-N. And I think I've asked him three times to tell me. Just think about kindergarten. I get like, oh. And then my niece is- They're going to call him A-A. Like, A-A-Bailey. She's going to get- A-A-Bailey. That's all I'm going to say. Heaven forbid she has some kind of speech impediment. Or likes goats. I mean- Oh, my gosh. Like, the Taylor Swift song. OK. So anyway, and then my niece is going to be Carolina Finch. And my dad and my- W-R. Carolina W-R. So I call her G-Debs already. Everyone calls me Tre. Alessia. I pronounce it Aria. But then I became a doctor. And so everybody thought it was pretty funny. OK. I digress. Sorry. Anyway.

Gavin likes basketball. That's as much as I've got now, Gavin. You're doing well in school. What questions do you have for me? None, actually. Something about your wrist I saw. That was me, apparently. Yeah, I told her. So we were playing basketball. And I caught the ball weird. And- It was like one hand. And so I messed up my wrist. And I couldn't move it. And it just kept popping it and going like this. After three days it popped. She thought it was... It was a lot longer than three days. No, it was three days. I promise you. I actually promised you. It was longer than three days because... I don't know. I don't think he promises anything. Which is the same. Because I kept track because I'm like, we're at day seven and then I like kind of stopped. You know, he wasn't complaining as much about it because of the scytropha and Brianna and I like with these joint things. I'm like hypocondylitis. I know it was more than three. But it's fine. Apparently. Well, maybe it only bothered him. Yes. Yes. Approximately three days later and it popped and then felt better. Like... Don't answer your phone. Let me touch him. Who is that? What's her name? It could be interviewed. Oh, are you sure? Can I answer? Okay. It's in voice lines. He just applied like seven times. To be fair, we were speaking off to the side for so long. I'm like, hold on. I've got to do something. Oh, Amazon customer support. What? I love it. Sorry. No, it's okay. I get it. I'm like, go. And I also told your mom, I'm like, dude, we were talking over here for a while and we're like, no, you're not paying attention to us. Okay. So did it pop and then feel better? Well, it was just like gradually I just popped it more and more and then it was good. So with the popping, the popping made it feel better. Yes. Because it just felt like it was tight. So then I just felt like this. I wonder if you like displaced a little tendon, like over one of those. Was it on this side of your wrist? Like the thumb side? Yeah. Right here. Cause there's this little tendon that goes in this groove here that you could pop out. And then if you keep trying, well, you can even see my tendon move. That's creepy. If you keep trying to like, then you could pop it back in. Maybe I did that. That's all better. Cool. Don't do that again. Look at that. That's why you're paying me. No, I really like you aren't having like morning joint pain. Okay.

How are all the things with, let me remember you had, yeah, growth hormone deficiency and we're still on the crap show trying to get different shots. Cause the Skytropha you spoke about. Yeah. They're not doing that. And so now we've got to go to the, cause the insurance will not cover it anymore. And so now we go back to the daily and so we're on the melody of the day. Cause Skytropha's once a month? Once a week. But it's such a crap show down there with the doctors, the endo. Oh, I know. Like who he, Popovich. She's from what? Philadelphia. They fly her in once a month. Boom. It's ridiculous. I get it. And I guess I'm like 90 year old all the time. She's super sweet. Oh yeah. And who was the other? Oh, I forget. I had to send a young girl there for precocious puberty and she was like dying. Like he's like 94. She goes, a grandpa saw me and I was like, I'm sure that's what you wanted with your puberty puberty appointment. But you know what? He was super old school. Like he knew, like he was very intelligent. He did my heart rate with just his hand. Yeah. Like I'm surprised he didn't walk in with a black bag. Like a little house in the Prairie all the way. Um, so we only saw him once. Cause I don't know if he, I'm sorry. I wrote that last night. He was like hardly shuffling and they were helping him into the room. Guys, I'm retired. No, he was really Danish. Danish. Yes. Like for his age though. Like I want to say, how'd you notice that? Cause he was like, he walked in pretty normally. Well, she was helping him by his elbow. Maybe she was just showing in which door. I don't know. I don't remember. It's a crap shoot over there right now. These poor people. But to be fair, what sane pediatric endocrinologist wants to work in a state where they're criminalizing physicians? And you risk jail time for being able to accept that someone might have different beliefs than you do. Yeah. I'm like, now they just passed a law about us speaking to kids alone. Yep. So you're not allowed to anymore? Without parental consent. And I'm like, what physician? Like this wasn't a problem. What physician was like dragging out a parent kicking and screaming and being like, I will speak to your child. I always ask for her admission. Right. And if they say no to me, it's a red flag. I'd never force it and be like, well, too bad. You have no rights. Right. But like, I absolutely would be like, okay. I've got more questions to ask. Right. In front of you. Then I guess we'll awkwardly do this all together. Yeah. You know. Right. And like, I'll assume. But you'll know by body language of children or whatever. Oh, absolutely. Especially when I talk about, you know, more sensitive things. I'm like, okay, do you want to hear about the amount of sex your child's having? Because if so, please stay in the room. Yeah. I mean, anyways. Okay. Yeah.

So that's, I don't even know, like, do you want alternatives to endo? Or are you guys like, it's working. Endo. It's an endocrinologist. Yeah. So the doctors who do, like, prescribe it. Like when? Is there anybody else? I mean. Or is it going to be like that everywhere? It's going to, I mean, locally. It would be more like telehealth meeting people in, like, Utah or Seattle. Yeah. Right. We don't go enough. But you're so close to probably being done with this. Correct? Yeah. Okay. They're just, they never get back at you. No, they're so busy. Yes. They even, he had one of my kids who has panhypopituitarism. So a part of the brain that produces a lot of hormones doesn't work, period. And they had asked about stresstocian cortisol at school. And he was like, oh, it's Dr. Rana. Just let her handle that. And I was like, pause. Who prescribes the hydrocortisone, Tommy? I mean, I have his cell phone number. We're on the same fantasy football team. So I was like, out of anyone, is it me that you're going to do? I was like. Yeah. Like, dude, don't tell me to write the letter for stresstose. But more it was like, hey, are you okay? Because he, like, he can't. He can't take care of all of this. And so mostly with patients, oh, dude, look at your growth, though. Yeah. I mean, that's pretty terrible. Yeah, I thought it was 5'2"". Ah, 5'5"". Yeah, no, this is a lot more. Right? We could have picked taller parents, too. So, like, bad move there. Right. But. I'll stay on you. Yeah, I mean, this was part of your fault as a zygote. But, you know, I mean, you're going to be at least 5'5"". Give that to me. I'll take it. You know, yeah, my husband's 5'9"". Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. I think it's, like, and you are, if you continue at this rate, what's your growth velocity? 5'7"". Yeah, 5'8"". No, 3 inches in the last year. Mm-hmm. You're thinking mid-parental height, but you've grown 3 inches. What am I estimating? Because I remember last time I was estimating 5'7"". Oh, it's going to stay the same because it's based upon your parents. I know. I thought it would have to be changed. So mid-parental height is an imperfect calculation taking into account your mother's height and your father's height. Here's the hilarious thing that they don't really say. In the calculation it gives you the answer like 5'7"", plus or minus 4 inches. That's good. Is an 8 inch range acceptable for anyone? So really when you look at that graph, so this is mid-parental. It could be anywhere from here, which spoiler alert, we already know isn't going to happen because you're taller than that, to here. And I don't know. How tall is that? That would be 5'11"". Good luck. I mean the slope of the curve, it kind of depends on the next few years. Now the only thing under your control besides a growth hormone, the two things that affect it the most are nutrition. I told you. And sleep. Okay, sleep is easy for me. He actually has been, even like the last two weeks, he'll come home, run upstairs, like he's like, he sleeps for like three hours. I'm like what are you doing? He's growing. Yeah, I'm like okay. But he's always been a early kid so it's weird for him, but I know it's not weird for teenagers. No. As long as you still then sleep at night. Yeah, I could have been like no. Yeah, like the kid turns his stuff in, his electronics, because the kids in there will have to keep the electronics overnight or anything like that. He's supposed to have them turned in by 9. He turns them in like 8.30, 8.45. Okay, I'm going to bed. I'm like, when I say he's a good kid, he's a good kid. You know, we don't have to worry about him. But he's also got a lot of siblings. He's like, I don't want to do that and I don't want to do that. Amen. And I mean 15, like over the next few years to remember Gavin, because whenever I hear people, and this is not throwing you under the bus, characterized as the good kid, you're allowed to also be a human. Mm-hmm. Right? Like please don't let that define who you are. Right. Right. Just making sure. He knows he doesn't want kids early. Do you know how to prevent that? Yes. Awesome. You don't go out with girls. You just stay and play video games. That's how you prevent that. I mean there are certain ways to not make babies. Yes. Yes. But if you have any questions, it's, I hate to say, until we develop a male birth control that's better than a condom, which even if the person you decide to have sex with, you're wearing a condom, or they're on birth control, please wear a condom. I mean all our kids, every single one of them, is birth control or depo babies. I mean like the pill or depo. Every one of them. Yeah. And so that doesn't even count. Don't even count that. And look at all your siblings. Here's more proof. You want some? I got some. To be fair, that was my husband's entire family. Mm-hmm. Except him. Literally every one of his three siblings, or four kids, all had kids very young. They were on us, in my family it's thirties. Mm-hmm. You start having kids. So his family was like, you guys are like 22, 23, where are the kids? And we were like, please. I was in med school. Right. And I was like, okay, well as soon as he grows a uterus, we'll let you know. Right. I'm busy. And yeah. And then when we got pregnullt at 25, very intentionally, his family was like, my family is like, it's okay. Like normally, like your twenties are for you, your thirties are for kids.

yeah yeah so it's fun no matter how you do it you're doing it wrong yeah um and you just don't listen to anybody no no and all my friends we were the first ones to get married the first ones to have kids and it wasn't right no it was just then nobody knows what they have to do with you they're all like oh cool let's go to Vegas and party for a week for wedding and that's yeah you know yeah then your best man's drunk at the wedding yep that's all right okay this was a really helpful visit for you guys i'm really excited to see the note that gets generated it's a good test for it yes i told them too i said i'm pretty because i'm piloting it for them there's like oh no any of us i was like i'm a good person to pilot it with because i have a lot of side conversations so it better be able to filter all that out that's why i ended up protective services show i'm just kidding you're gonna be like Gavin a 22 year old recently impregnated three babies yeah exactly he thought his 30s were going to be for kids but he didn't use a condom consistently i'm just really excited for whatever it says in my last one i had an 18 month old playing around and there was trash like he was playing with the tissue and i said oh can you help me put this away because yeah we throw it away in the trash can and he goes oh he loves to throw stuff away and then he was playing with my stethoscope and we commented on that and in my note it goes um the child prefers to play with items such as trash and medical instruments it was like true to be fair yeah not useful to have in my note during his 18 month well check your heart sounds healthy my friend take a big breath good job another one any kiddo yesterday i was sitting there i said take a big breath and i was waiting and i look at her and she's like i said oh and let it out she's like oh it's like oh you're concrete okay i get it so what are you thinking after high school landed um maybe i don't know yet but maybe a gap year and then do it probably um some sort of going to like get a job obviously during the gap year make some money right and then i don't know if i want to just have like a normal job or just be an entrepreneur so oh what would like what area do you think you're interested in for entrepreneur big tech yeah love it what sir what do you call it because the vending machines he owns a business oh i think i remember this what do you do vending machines and candy machines smart yeah so i mean he's kind of interested in architecture that kind of thing but yeah that's a backup plan that's a lot of schooling that's super expensive that there's i mean the world's different right now even than like when we were going through school or parents and like you just you have to go to college and now i'm like amen yeah when a youtuber can make six times what i do i think we can re-examine our whole plan exactly just do what you love you can just stick the gun to the side good job yeah that's what i i just think figure out what And it doesn't even have to be like your passion, but figure out what you don't hate doing all day every day. If it pays well, do it. We have a friend who's given up his drone business and told me, you can have it. Come take my drone and do an ad. I'd like to buy it though. It's expensive. But he would carry you on it and he does all the ad stuff. All the ads? Ad. So he goes and takes pictures of aerials of their fields. Oh, sweet. And so he would have a clientele right out the gate. Yeah. I have one of those fancy drones. Yeah. But right now it's one of those DJI ones, so it's like... Oh, yeah. So it can survive the wind and stuff like that. Yeah. Quit looking down here. Keep talking. Um... Normal. Try to stand up. Face the window. Come stand. Face the window. See, I do that part quite down. Bend over, touch your toes, show me your back. There you go. Come up just a little bit. I can't do this. I know. And I do worry about this because my niece is totally S. Okay. Relax down here. Straighten up your feet. Point both forward. Go like that. Okay. Hang forward. It's like here. Okay. I fixed it. Okay. Wait, what? Did it feel rotated? No. Are you a chiropractor? What'd you do? I am. Are you surprised? I'm a magician. No, I just... You were kind of going when you bent forward. You were kind of this. Did you feel that? No. And then when I moved you, just... He's a little slouchy. I don't know where he gets that. I know. I always sit up straight. All the time. Always. No, your back looks fine. You don't have back pain or anything? Okay. No. I don't think he's the ticking time bomb for autoimmunity. I mean, he has the Y. So autoimmune diseases. Oh. Yeah. Where your body attacks it. So, I mean, the Y chromosome of being a male is in your favor. Most of these things are more likely in women. Oh. Interesting. Not all. I don't know why. We taught it. It's like X and it has a letter above it. And then Y. Wait. That's math. No, in biology. In biology. It has a letter over it? Yeah. So XX is male. Or female. XX is female. And then XY is male. Yes. And then the Y can't carry a disorder or something. Mitochondrial. Yes. Yes. Wow. You know that. Yeah. Mitochondrial disorders. You know mitochondria back from cell biology? Itty bitty powerhouse of the cell. It has DNA inside of it that comes from mom only. So you're absolutely correct, sir. Also, on that short arm, you know, that's taken away so that it becomes a Y, is like things like organization and thinking. I'm just kidding. No. I'm like, that sounds fair. I'm with you. I'm with you. Right. Also, you should have seen me at 15. No, you don't want to see me at 15. No one believes that I am who I am today. Yeah. 15 is hard for a lot of people. Yes. Not for me. Well, then you'd come along. Oh, yeah. You can ask Sister nullcy. Oh, gosh. And Rick, who was the detention officer in my high school. Sounds like me. Because I would show up late, so I had to go to Rick's office. She showed up. I don't know if I... After a little bit. He's like, Alessia, you smell like cigarettes, and I was like, cool, check. We had parking lot peeks. I went to Centennial. Oh. And, yeah, he would wait. He'd just wait for me. He'd wait for me to pull, and I'm like, Kyle! He'd be in between the cars. I'm like, really? We all know. Can we just stop the game? I'll meet you tonight. Maybe it will skip. Well, no, I guess it didn't skip a generation for you, but maybe. Maybe, yeah. Being late. No, being like... Naughty. Following the rules. He's actually a pretty good kid. You have the most fun. Yeah. Good. Yeah. I was like, also, now's the time to make mistakes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's a nice kid. He doesn't... He's never... You've been in trouble once or twice, but nothing... Good. Nothing bad. Kind of like Brianna. Like, she would defend the little guy, and then get out of her space a little bit. Right. And, that's kind of more like him. And, you know what? I'd rather you be in trouble for standing up for somebody. Amen. Than punch somebody in the face, or whatever. Or, you know, whatever. Yes. This is true. So, rare circumstances. Mm-hmm. Okay.

No vaccines today that I saw. No. And, so, I guess I'll just plan it. It feels so weird to only see you in a year, but I'll see you in a year, dude. Yeah. Okay. Really? No. Unless I get quite ready to let this go. No. Just kidding. No. For me, eight months. Did you need... I thought it was like eight months. No. For what? Checkups. No. I mean, you're welcome to always... It's always been a year? Mm-hmm. It's been that long. Eight months is another thing. When they're babies, it's two months. Like, initially. Has it ever been six months? Because I think... Yeah. Well, for your endo, it's every six. Yeah. Well, I don't know... There you go. Endo is... Yeah. Endocrine. Oh. Hormone. Totally. Don't worry. We got you. Vaccines. Uh-huh. We are wondering if there's too many too fast and spacing some things out. Don't do that. Okay. But, rather than just say that, let me send you information. Right. And, she's not saying anti. She's just saying space. Because I don't... We're not anti-vaxxers at all. All my kids are. Absolutely. I'm just not huge on the HPV one. Just because I know some people who've had adverse reactions cannot... That's her vaccine. Yeah. Any immune system activation, when you have a predisposition and you may not know, can cause... And that's what I'm wondering. Because I watched Brianna's vaccine go into her leg and her skin boil. She's my only kid. And, I didn't know any of this stuff back then. I didn't... It didn't even occur to me with any of the others. Any vaccine could have done it. Right. Or getting mono, getting a cold, COVID. Yeah. Any immune system activation. Yeah. And, we can't prevent them all. Now, what would be worse is cervical cancer. Yeah. So, Mia and I... She's, you know... She goes, what are they going to have her do right away? And, I said, I don't know. Immediately, the only one that's allowed is hepatitis B. And, with that one, I give it to my kids because I'm a health care worker. Yeah. She's gotten regular prenatal care. We could elect to wait until two months. The risk is the very low chance, but possible, that if a baby contracts hepatitis B, which is despite the internet, not just IV drug users, they can live on surfaces for seven days. And, babies are very vulnerable when they're first born. Right. There's a 90% chance of causing cirrhosis of the liver. Okay. I see very little risk to the vaccine. They are born with mom's antibodies. Right. And, they're pretty well protected. So, definitely vitamin K for the love. Yeah. Hepatitis B, erythromycin, ointment, please rub it all over their eyes. They just came out really dirty. area. And then nothing until two months. And then at two months, and I can go through it with her, but we do it in a mindful way. The reason we have the schedule we have is because by six months, their immunity wanes and it's no longer going to talk to us. And her thought, she goes, I don't even want anybody at the hospital. And I said, okay. And she says, you're not kissing this baby. She got the RSV vaccine, right? She's, um, what is it where they'll, her body will reject the way they've got different blood types. So I know she did that. Oh, like ABO or whatever. Yeah. And that will matter around delivery too. Okay. But I think, I'm not sure she did the RSV. Tell her I can send her any info she wants. It's supposed to happen between 32 to 36 weeks. She wanted in, she's past. She's 36. That was her 36 week ultrasound. Get it now. Okay. Two weeks before baby's born and provides protection against RSV, which is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants until it provides the protection up to 15 months of age. It's a vaccine she gets, passes to the baby. Okay. Um, yeah. Cause she's like, I don't think I want anybody there. I'm not sure if I'm going to get to go, but she goes, you're not going to, can't I kiss a baby? I'm like, Oh, fine. Okay. Maybe I'll be able to talk her down just a little bit. Well, but you know, cause she, her thought was, I'm not going to do these all right now. So I'm going to protect my baby. So there's not going to, so I, so like I said, she's not an anti-vaxxer, but she's wanting to just continue to do her research and she's just running out of time. Tell her, don't worry, let me do it for her. Okay. But if she listens, this, it's a book or you can listen to it. It is a really nice way. Cause what I don't like is people don't vaccinate out of fear and because they left their children and they want to do the best thing for them. And then we come at them with fear, right? About not vaccinating and I don't find it helpful. Right. And like, so she's, I don't want to say she's on the fence. Like she wants the protection. She needs data. She needs data, but she also you know, sometimes if they have a predisposition to autoimmune or whatever, the best thing to do would be to do it while they're already protected with moms. And so a lot of tell her it sounds straightforward and simple and people will say things that are unfortunately wrong. When you look at data, I, the data's on the side of vaccination in almost every, almost every circumstance. Right. And I do believe that there's probably some kids who've gotten medical conditions where you can't do these things. So there's some things you're not going to know until you don't. And the truth is we've done so many studies about association and causation. Like all that's been done. She doesn't have to reinvent. This is the best book for that. Okay. I loved it. And expecting better. But you're okay if she's wanting to maybe space some things out. If need be. Are you supportive in that way? If opinion be, I mean there's no risk free option. What she's trading it for is more exposures to clinic. Okay. And so I do it for people if they understand that it's not the care I would give my own kids, which always kind of, I'm like, right. And that I worry, especially as we get into the fall and winter being in here more. Right. And what I found is when people get the data they deserve, a hundred percent. If you're waiting on them, what does that wait look like? I mean, you're not waiting until they're 10, you know? But is it, people make it up as they go. Like, that's what's hard for me. And they're like, well, tell me the ones that you would do. And I'm like, it's like asking me what day of the week to drive without a seatbelt on. Yeah. Like, to me, because we have a measles outbreak in eight states in this country. We have pertussis. Right, is that the MMR? Because I think she was talking about the MMR. MMR is at age one. Okay. Not now. Okay. We can't, because it's a live attenuated, we can't do that until baby's one. And even at one, there's two indicated MMR varicella. I split them. Varicella's at 15 months. Okay. So. And you split them. You split them. I split them because they're quite the, so every time you do an immune system activation, you want the most benefit with the least amount of side effects. Right. And they both activate the immune system. And that's what she's after. She's not, because some of these are like, do it all, get it out, and then you're done. And she's like, I don't think I want that. Tell her I got your back. Yeah. I feel like a lot of people, when they're on the fence like she is, and I go through it, they're like, oh, I'm like, we aren't gonna slam your baby with all these things. This is why we do it. They won't listen. Right. And they won't ask, tell me why. Right. And that's what, yeah, I think she just wants, more or less, to have an opinion and be heard and understand what's going on. And tell her I can talk her through it. I essentially feel everything else is gray. There's so much gray area in parenting. I can even teach her how to co-sleep safely. There's tons of data out of New Zealand. I have a calculator. And she's not even gonna do that. I'm like. I have tons of things. It's gray. Vaccines, aside from certain ones, that's black and white. Yeah. But you don't know that until you get the data. Right. Mom is just like, silly things. She wants me to make broccoli cheese soup for her. And I'm like, broccoli is gonna be not good for the baby if you're breastfeeding. So it means there's so many things. She's like, mom, there's a lot of things. But that's a lie. Oh, really? That's milk's made from blood. She'll never get that. What kind? I could bake her anything. I mean. Anything. Spicy? Absolutely. It goes through her stomach, right? So there's a lot of beliefs. But that's why alcohol, you still can't get it through your blood, right? So you can't while you're pregnullt. Because when you're pregnullt, you're sharing your blood with the baby. You guys are the same blood system, right? So if your blood alcohol level is 0.05, 0.08, you can't drive, that's the baby's blood alcohol level with a dumb liver, right? What about with weed? Is it the same thing? Weed is horrific because it's lipophilic. What does that mean? So lipophilic means fat loving. Oh. So when it's fat loving, what area of your body, when you're an itty bitty fetus, has the most fat? Oh. Oh. So it'll affect your brain. And we have studies. So no THC while pregnullt or breastfeeding. Yeah. And she doesn't do anything with that. Really? That's okay. I love edibles, but not while I'm breastfeeding. Right. And then with alcohol, you're sharing the blood. Once you give birth, your blood is used to make your milk, which they drink. Right. You have a blood alcohol content of, let's just be crazy, 0.8. Mm-hmm. You're dead. Right. That's the blood alcohol content of. what they would be drinking that's less than orange juice because it ferments. You mean I could have had so much easier? Dude, I have to give this knowledge to so many breastfeeding moms and I'm like yes you will see me sitting there with my friends drinking wine at the same time as I breastfeed my baby because I have data. Right. Now I didn't touch it in pregnullcy. Right. Because I have data. Right. I will not touch an edible because I have data. Right. So like there are certain things where you know we believe it or people be like oh I quit eating peppers because they make me gassy and then he got gassy and I'm like that's not what happened. Right. I'm like what and like here's how it works. I wonder that because Alyssa like no matter what I did she it was just her belly her belly since the day she was born. It was probably microbiome. Right. There's a lot of things but like there are definitely gray areas. Yeah. Vaccine's not one of them. Okay. I'll tell her I will high-five her for having a glass of wine while she's breastfeeding her baby when it comes to vaccines. It's not that I won't. I don't want people who are on the fence to go to these quack doctors who aren't going to talk to them about vaccines. They kind of be. Right. But what I tell them is I really feel like if you have the right data. Right. That you are going to do it. Yeah. The way that I recommend. So tell her I'll talk to her. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Lennox you're an incredibly patient. Sorry we should have like way more time this round and I apologize. That's all right. I'm excited to see this note. I feel like I should copy and paste it and send it to you guys and then edit it before I do. Bye friends. Good to see you. Oh my gosh. Okay. Seriously. I know. I don't know. They're hilarious.

B08.1 Molluscum contagiosum","It sounds like Noah. Not really, other than he has a moluscle. Moluscle contagioso. Yeah, okay. Is it just on this knee? It's only on that knee. That's good. And all over. Is it all over? Okay, yeah. Did you guys share it? Yeah. That's nice. Sharing is caring. Yeah, so it's, yeah, it's the second name of it is contagioso, so it's contagious, so it definitely can move around.

The only thing is, there's nothing that officially treats it. There's nothing that, like, if you, I mean, there are things that help with it, but it's like a viral thing. Kind of like in the wart family. But if you itch it, what? It can take, like, six months to years. Yeah, like, it can take years, especially if you're scratching at it, if you're moving it around, you know. So, yeah, so when it comes to, like, you know, places like on the knee, obviously we want to make sure we're not itching at it too much. So you can do some cortisone cream if you're itching at it. It irritates me. It irritates you? Okay. Cortisone cream can kind of help with it, but there's a lot, so there's nothing that we medically will say, this is what we diet, like, this is what we treat for it. But there's a lot of moms out there, my kid included, who have tried different things, and tea tree oil is one thing.

So do you have Amazon? So as soon as you type in, like, M-O-L-L, a ton of things will come up. There's one, like, called, like, Moleskine Blast. That's what I would recommend you do. So tea tree oil and something called Moleskine Blast. You kind of stick up with it, like, stay up with it. Like, Moleskine Blast, I think that it says, like, applying it, like, several times a day, you know, for the best results. But, and tea tree oil, like I said, it's what I've been told really helps with it, too. This one's not too bad, too. And allergies, his nose is always running. Okay. Always. Has it always been like that? It's always been like that. Okay. Have we done anything allergy-wise? Allergies, you met, it's an over-the-counter, but it's still.

Okay. One big thing I will say, is the house very cold? Not really. No? It's not very cold. Kind of. Okay. So house really cold, you know, dust in the house, which, like I said, ceiling fan blades, those carry a lot of dust. Yeah, the ceiling fan blades is in her room. Okay. So, so yeah, so that will definitely carry a lot of dust that can cause him to have those allergies. But what is he taking right now for allergies? Over-the-counter product from Amazon, just cheap. I don't even know what it's called. Chewable allergy medicine. Okay. There's several of them, so that's what I was trying to see which one he's on. But Claritin, Zyrtec, those are the big ones. Zyzol, Allegra, those are like the main four ones that are on the market right now. But if he, his nose is running? Yeah, it doesn't stop. Okay. Any other allergy symptoms? Itchy eyes? Okay. Okay. And it's 365? Okay. Here, how about on the table, buddy? We'll get you on the table. Okay, so going back to allergy meds. So yes, you basically would want to change it to see if he's gotten more resistant to it. So whatever he's on right now, you know, I mean, we can send an allergy med. It would be what you get over-the-counter and see how he does with that.

But it's kind of harder to know which one to give him if we don't know what he's on right now. Yeah. Let me pull up my Amazon account. Sometimes they have like a generic name. Yeah, it's a generic something. Cetirizine, loratadine. No shots for you too, buddy. Okay. You don't want any? No. You don't have any? No, it's because we're supposed to get them when we get in the hospital. Well, no, before then. Yeah, before. 11. Oh, yeah. You were right. It was 11. 11 or 12. You never listen. Good job. What grade are you in right now? Second. That's Claritin. So you can try some Zyrtec. Okay. So you might become resistant to that. That could be why. I can send some Zyrtec and see if that will help. Have you ever tried like a nasal spray? No. Some kids don't like nasal sprays because they literally snort it and it hurts, you know? But if you just take it and just have them just simply like breathe. Just like, just have them. Sometimes it will help too. So I can try to send some Flonase too.

Okay. See if that will help. And look at your ears, buddy. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There you go. Let's see those teeth. Good job. Good job. You didn't brush them this morning? Oh my goodness, you forgot? Okay, go ahead and lay down for me really quick. Lay down. Lay down. Lay down. Oh my goodness. You forgot. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Except for the tooth. Oh, that's all right. This is the one table that sits so hard open. There it goes. It gets stuck in there. All right. You know, I'm seeing them here. Okay. You see them over here, too? Yeah, I know. Okay. Real quick, peek into your underwear to make sure we're growing okay, buddy. Okay? I do apologize. Yep, but make sure look over at Mommy. Mommy's here. If Mommy's not in the room, if Mommy's not in the room nobody looks down there, buddy, okay? Remember it that way. Okay. All right. Real quick peek. Anything hurt down here? No. No? Okay. All right. Making sure we have all the right equipment, buddy. I know. I know. I don't see any lesions on them. That's good. Okay. Like I said, try and see if we can find something kind of over the counter that will help. Yeah, those are kind of hard on us, too. Yeah, they pop. Yeah, they pop a little bit because I fold them a lot. Should we do some of the dermatology? No. Dermatology to see? Okay. Well, I go to the... They look like they're getting big, too. Yeah. So maybe both of them for dermatology? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.",,,

Z23 Need for influenza vaccination","I know we got discharged on the 4th, so 4 days ago, how have we been since we've been discharged? Like we're doing all that, okay good, and I'm glad you know what that looks like to call 911, I'm sure that was so scary, I'm so sorry, oh my gosh, no fever since? The hospital? No. Okay, good. And our runny nose and cough, is it a little bit better now? It is a little bit better compared to how it was at the hospital. Thank goodness. Is your eating okay? Pain and pooping all right? Oh yeah. Yay. He got his appetite back from last week. Oh my gosh, yay. I'm so sorry he's been in the ICU twice now.

I don't think it helps with his- even though he does have the pacemaker, I don't know if that like puts him more at risk of like having. The cardiologist to tell me that it does. Yeah, okay, okay, good. So I actually wanted to ask. Yes, yes. I know we had talked about the COVID shot last time around. Yeah, yeah. And that's. something that we can get maybe today um I just I wish we did but we don't have the new Cobra chest I wish I know I know um we I think we're getting it in soon okay um but we just don't have it today but I totally would if that's what you want um and yeah we can do that um maybe it It's going to be 2 months from now until his 1-year checkup.

So maybe call back in like maybe 2 or 3 weeks. And when do you guys get the flu vaccines in? We are getting, we're supposed to get them in this week. Let me ask if we have any. and then we can definitely do the flu shot if you want, for sure. Okay, that way if we come back for the COVID, I can bring Alex as well and just get his nose done. Oh, yes, perfect, yes, and then also since this would be his first flu season, because he's, you know, he's 10 months old, so I'm glad we already got the RSV, but for the flu, since this would be his first flu shot, he would need 2 doses like 4 weeks apart, so at least if we do the first dose today. -day, then we could do the second dose 4 weeks from now, and he could get like the first COVID vaccine if we have it then, so that, the timing would work out good.

Hi buddy, I hope we're on the, we're on the mend and we don't go back to the hospital for a long time, oh my gosh. You've been through a lot, buddy. Yes, I know you always like me and watch all of my downy pussy. Hi. Gosh. You have been through so much and you are just so happy. A lot of care in the world. I'm sure everyone in the hospital loves him. Oh my gosh, yes.

If we still have that wet cough in like a week or so, you let me know because then we might need some antibiotics for a sinus infection, okay? Okay. but because he started with symptoms, was it the day that you got? It was last Saturday that he started with symptoms. Oh okay, yeah, so we're still kind of in the, we're still kind of in the, what's it called? In the virus phase. Do you think it's getting a little bit drier or you think it's still a wet cough? I think it's still pretty much the same. Oh, it's the same thing, yeah. I want to say over a week ago now. Yeah, 7 days. It's not as constant, but it's still very, yeah. It's so wet sounding. Okay, but I'm glad no fever. Let's check your ears. Let's make sure we don't have an ear infection. Good job. Oh yeah, you have hiccups. Ears look a tiny bit red. You know, I think I'm going to start antibiotics now because that cough is so like wets- Sunday, and so, yeah.

We always have the same clock. Oh, yikes, for how, the same, amount of time? We're definitely on the same time. Oh, yikes. His insurance actually just terminated and I've been fighting with my- I'm going permanent to get him on our insurance. Okay, yes, yes. So I haven't been able to bring him. Okay, okay. Kind of still up in the air to get his insurance together. Okay, I'm so sorry, okay. If you download GoodRx. for him at least because I can send in antibiotics for both, oops, honey. I drank it. Then sometimes it can help with the cost of the antibiotics since we're in between insurances right now. Yeah. But I think Carlos definitely needs antibiotics for his sinus infection wet sounding cough because that's too wet and then he's been having it for more than a week now so he should have been a little bit better and a little bit more dry.

ulld let's see, then with Henry, let's see, and I'm going to send in for Henry too, does he have any other symptoms aside from like the wet sound and cough, like fever? No. Okay, good, good, and I'm going to send... Over to, let me see, here. I guess they started with the same rhinovirus the same time and then now it's turned into a sinus infection because this has been going on for too long. Yeah, and I think especially because it was me and my husband- been staying at the hospital with him and my parents taking care of Alex. Uh-huh. I don't want to say that I wasn't treated the way I should. Yeah, I know. And then it happens, it happens. So I'm going to send both of their antibiotics to CVS on the South 75th Street. Yes. And any new allergies for any of them that I need to know about? No. Okay, good, thank goodness, okay, well I'm going to send it there, but it's going to be, at least they're going to be on the same schedule twice a day for 10 days, it's just that both of their antibiotics are going to be different doses because you got very different cell weights, but otherwise you- you call me and let me know if they're not better in a week, okay?

Okay. But give the antibiotic 2 to 3 days to kick in. Okay. And the cough should sound a little bit more dry. Okay. But since they've been coughing for so long, there's like a post inflammatory post-viral cough that's a very dry cough that's here and there so not constant but it can last up to three or four weeks. Oh my goodness. I know just keep that in mind after the 10 days okay 10 days of antibiotics and have them eat something with probiotics once a day so that they don't get diarrhea on that antibiotic.

Okay. Any other questions at all? No. But keep doing the nasal suctioning, the Sarebe's, you know, coma, cement, fire, steam, bathroom, all that good stuff, alright? Okay. You get better soon, stop getting so- sick. Oh, he's like silent. He's like, mommy, you stopped getting sick. Yes, you cutie pie. Oh my gosh. Y'all take care, okay?

ully other questions at all? You're welcome. No, that was good. Thank you so much. I'm sending everything there, okay? You're welcome. And then take your time going out, all right? Bye-bye. Thanks for coming early, buddy. Oh my gosh, it's your kid. Y'all take care. Come in and meet me if you're welcome. Hi. Hey, oh my gosh, hi. How are you? I'm good. Do you have any foster dogs? Hi.

Yeah, one of the times we were here. Oh, perfect. I think we're all over that, I don't remember. Nice. Yeah, I guess that was, it's been like a few months now, so I'm right at that level of like, I don't remember when I started using this and who's seen it and who hasn't. Right. Awesome.

How do you feel like you're doing with your eating lately, Lucas? Good. Good. What's your favorite food these days? Macaroni and cheese. Oh my goodness, macaroni and cheese is so good, right? Awesome. Well, with our eating effort, we want to get lots of different types of foods, okay? So that means we're getting some macaroni and cheese. It means we're getting fruits and vegetables. proteins, proteins are like our meat, beans, eggs, nuts, and cheese, like in your macaroni and cheese, and then we also want to be getting grains, it's like our pasta, like in your macaroni and cheese, and breads, and things like that, okay, and then also some good fats, which you'll, if you're eating the other things, you'll get those in there too. How do you feel like you're doing with eating all the different types of foods? Good. Good? Do you agree, mom? Yes. Perfect. He's such a good eater. Awesome. I love it. Awesome. Awesome. Keep up the good work, okay?

Great. And then I know kind of silly question here, my friend, but are you doing okay with peeing and pooping lately? Good. Awesome. And how about brushing your teeth? Good. Good. How about flossing? Do you floss? Not normal. Not normally? That's all right. That's a hard one to get in the habit of for sure. Yeah, we have the little pics that they do when, just, you know. Yeah, yeah. And we're at that age, it really becomes important as we've got more adult teeth coming in, it's more just getting in that good habit right now and all of that, so. Awesome. All right. Well, great. Well, keep up the good work with that, okay? And it looks like you're sleeping pretty well lately. Yeah? Falling asleep every night okay? Or most nights okay? Good.

Do you stay asleep most of the time once you fall asleep? We're not normal. Not normal? Sorry, stay asleep until the morning, not just stay asleep forever. I'm in. I'm not going to sleep forever. You're going to sleep forever? Oh, I hope not. No. Just kidding. Just kidding. You sleep until the morning, usually? No. Yes. Yeah. No. Lily usually wakes you up. Oh my goodness. Huh. Yeah. All right. Any snoring or odd breathing you're noticing every night or anything? No. Okay. Beautiful.

All right. Well, development wise, looking through here, it looks like he's doing just about everything we asked about. Looks like still working on some of these kind of fine motor things. Although a lot of it is drawing and sometimes we have kids that just don't love. drawing that much and so- That can pop up. Were you kind of concerned about any of the the kind of fine motor stuff? No. Okay. Because we have a handwriting notebook. Oh yeah. That he can trace stuff in and he does that really well. Oh perfect. Good. But just drawing on his own is still just like. Excellent. Gotcha. Okay. What's that? Homework. Homework, nice, awesome. All right, and then speech, it looks like still working on a little bit of that kind of intelligibility. Do you feel like he's improving with time and getting more and more understandable? Yeah. Beautiful. Awesome. Any concerns you had about development at all? Otherwise, that's looking pretty darn normal to me.

No. Okay, awesome. All right, Lucas, and then you go to preschool, right? Okay. Awesome. How is preschool? We start next week. Oh, you start next week. Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. We will find out how preschool is, huh? Yes. It's usually a really, really fun year. So, awesome, great. The teacher, she was like, if your kids have a runny nose, I'm going to send them home. She's like, last year we had COVID, hand, foot, and mouth, lice, and pink eye go through our classroom like wildfire, and I was like. fun. Seriously. Awesome. Yay. That social development piece is really important. Yes. So yeah, it'll be worth it, but yeah, that does happen, doesn't it? Yeah. So hopefully less this year. Hopefully, I know. If she's really vigilant about sending people home right away, hopefully. Yeah.

We don't spread too much, but yeah. Awesome. It looks like you guys are doing a great job with exercise and screen time. Oh yeah. So getting exercise every day and keeping that screen time to a minimum is really great. Oh yes. Yeah, was that your back that just touched on there, or was that your arm? Oh, nice, I like it. Put my elbow on there, ready? Whoa, that was a good one. I love it. Awesome. Any questions you had about car safety, general safety around the house kind of stuff, water safety, all that? No, we did an entire summer of swim lessons and that went really well. We'll keep doing them, of course. Great, I love it.

So my goal for everybody- um, is that, I mean, if you want to become an Olympic swimmer, that's fine, right? I'm sure your mom would love that too, but, um, you don't have to be amazing, amazing at swimming, but we do have to be in a place where it would be, you would be safe if you fell into water accidentally, you could get yourself back out, okay? Awesome. It's called a wreck. The rec, yes. Yeah. We go to the rec. Perfect. I love it. Awesome. Can I show you how you're growing Lucas? Do you want to see? Yes. Alright, let's look. Okay, so weight is right on track here. He's following really nicely along this green line. So we're looking perfect there. And if we look at height, he is also following pretty close to that green line. So really consistent there as well. And then BMI, we are in a good healthy spot. overall around that green line, so looking beautiful there as well. All right. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, and breathing are looking perfect too. So all your numbers are exactly where they should be, okay?

So what this means is I need you to keep working on eating lots of good healthy foods and getting lots of exercise and getting good sleep and doing all the things we do to take care of our bodies, right? Okay. Okay. All right, I'm going to get my hands washed here, and then I wonder if you can climb up on that table for me. Perfect. Thank you for watching. you Okay. All right, Lucas. What would you like to start with today? Do you want to do my flashlights first or my stethoscope first? Stethoscope. Oh, beautiful. Alright, let's take a listen here. I love your chain today. I know, Dad bought it for me too. What's that? Dad bought me this. Dad bought it for you? That was so nice of him. I love it.

I need to finish that. Yeah. And even a shirt. Mm-hmm. Nice, oh my goodness. Yeah, you are looking very stylish today in general, huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I know. Let's take a listen to your heart here, kiddo. Great. Your heart sounds awesome. I'm going to have you take a big deep breath for me. Good job, and another. Great, two more. Awesome, last one. Perfect. All right, my friend. I've got a bright light for you here, okay? We're going to use that to look at your eyes. I'm going to have you look over. Can you see those gloves there? Okay, you look at the gloves, and I've got a bright light coming from the side here, perfect, and I'll have you look right here at my nose, another bright light. Great, you just follow my light with your eyes, try to keep your face facing still. So watch, you can follow with your eyes, so look right at my light and try to keep your head still. Yeah, perfect. All right, and then over the side. You got it. Beautiful. All right, and now I'll have you look up at the ceiling. Just peeking in your nose here. Ooh, yeah, and then say, ah, really big and wide. Ah. Oh, that was an awesome one. All right, which ear should we check first, Lucas? Okay, great choice. Looking good. Something on this side. Perfect. All right, my friend. I'm just going to check on your neck here. All right, everything is so normal so far, okay?

I'm going to have you lay down next. Alright, then we're going to check on your tummy next. Let me get my gloves on here. All right, so just checking on your tummy, I'm just going to kind of push here, let her get off. No. All right. He's got a little bit of molluscum here. Have you had kids like that? Yeah. Yeah. So no big deal. Super, super normal. Have you noticed these little bumps on your tummy? Yeah, so those are not going to hurt you at all and eventually your body will kind of fight them off and make them go away. If you guys wanted to speed up the process, you could try like tea tree oil on there, the Moleskine RX. product that you can buy can sometimes be helpful. Okay. And then I've had a couple kids who had some success with taking a zinc supplement by mouth and the idea is you kind of like ramp up the immune system and helps kind of fight them off. Okay. But they're completely harmless, you also don't have to do anything about them, they'll eventually go away.

Okay. So, yeah. All right, my friend, next we have to check under your underwear here, okay? And that is only okay because I'm a doctor and my job is to make sure your whole body is healthy. And because mom is- This right here is going to make sure you're safe, okay? So we're going to look really quick here, just going to check on pulses, great, and then checking on testicles here. There we go. All right, and then I'm going to have you stretch your legs out for me, and then if you can bend your knees for me too. Perfect. That's all I have for you today. Can I help you up? No, you don't even need to help. Nice job. All right, Lucas, you can stay here. You can sit next to mom, whatever you'd like to do. All right. Okay. He looks perfect.

All right. No concerns at all. Anything that I missed or other questions that you had? No? No. All right, great. Well, Jenna will be in for those four-year shots and we'll get you guys on your way, okay? Okay. And then next time I have to see you back, my friend, would be a year from now, okay? But if you need me for anything at all in the meantime, I'm happy to see you. I'm sure we'll see. Yeah, I'm sure. I will see someone from your family. Yes.

Well, what about my daughter? Well, it's nice now that the boys, the, my bonus boys go here too. I don't know, but I'm not sure who they see. I don't remember. What are their names? Um, Dylan and Blake and Jake Morales. Okay, I think, let me just look real quick, I think I've got them. Do you want to see Dr. Crash or do you see them? I think I've met them, but I don't know if they're, if they're mine. I can't remember too because everybody's sitting here, right? I'm like, who is actually my, my patients and who isn't? Let's see. I definitely know Blake and Dylan have been in. Okay. I have a lot of last name Morales patients. Here we go. Oh, yeah. Yep. Dylan is. Okay. Is mine and Blake also mine. Yep. Oh, perfect. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I know I know those names. But also the last name Morales and the first names Dylan and Blake are decently, decently common, so yeah, so awesome, all right, well it was a really nice seat, you know.

Well now I have to do my shots. Now you have to do your shots and then you get to get out of here. Yeah. Sounds fun? Go get breakfast. Nice. And ice cream. And ice cream. Oh my goodness. Are you going to have anything other than ice cream for breakfast? Or just ice cream today? Ice cream. Nice. I like it. Ice cream for breakfast is kind of fun every once in a while, right? Awesome. You're going to take one look at that buffet and be like, oh. Oh, yeah. Dude. That'll be awesome. Yeah, ice cream is a dessert. All right, it was lovely seeing you guys. Yes, me too. Yeah, let me know if you need anything, okay? Okay, thanks. All right, we'll see you later. All right, oh my gosh, so cute. I know, that kid's cooler than I was ever. Uh-huh, his chain reminds me a little bit of Liam Bennett, the chain that",,,
c38720eb-3708-4782-9a23-dbba8f4e3156,13.0,year,female,,F32.81 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder,"You guys. I am good. I'm good. Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom. I love when I get to just make you guys parents. So what's going on with this girl?

She's a moody, moody child. Oh, well. The age, the age tends to, uh, tends to do that. Yeah. Yes. So, but like, I started tracking it and we had mentioned it to you in the summer, but it's been a long time now.

But she takes, um, what does she take? Antidepressant. Prozac. Prozac. Okay. Yeah. And I don't know if that, I don't know if that helps her or doesn't help her. Um, we just switched to that from something else, but, um, but literally I started tracking it because she'll call me from school. Like in tears in the bathroom, you have to come and get me. I can't stay here. Blah, blah, blah. And it's usually like day 15 to day 20, like every single month.

Okay. And so, yeah. And so when I mentioned that to you in the, in the summer and we had talked about like, maybe we just need to start on the pill. Like maybe that's going to be. Yeah. The periods are a thing and they, they're a thing. I mean, like it's so easy, you know, she'll just be super upset about something that, I mean, whatever, you know, and I'll count the days and like, okay, yeah. Day 17, you know? So it's, it's, I mean, I think it's pretty clear. No, I think she doesn't have whatever other times, right. Because there are other times, I guess, but I think the most, the most times that the most times that it's so just down and out are usually the same time every month. Right. So that second half of your cycle. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's not, it's not uncommon, you know, to have those increased, you know, increased sadness and blues and, you know, all of the things around your cycles.

I mean, it's, it's well known. I'm like, you know, women will often just be on Prozac for half a month, you know? So. That's funny. But I mean, she's, so she, what was she taking first? Pristique. Pristique first. Yeah. And, and I guess we got to the top dose of that and it just didn't really do that much. So we went down and went up and went around the Prozac. So now the Prozac is on board, but I don't know if she's on board yet either, but, but still episodes, you're having episodes.

Well, how do you, I mean, how are you feeling? I mean, you're the one making the phone calls from school. I am. You're like, this is true. It is true. In fact, Mr. Grant's room goes wild for those calls. I mean, you know, like really like slumped in the, in the bathroom, calling me in tears. Sometimes I pick her up. Sometimes I don't. It depends on the mood. Yeah. She feel like driving. It's not that I just don't feel like I can always bring you home from school. Like I, you know, it's, I'm always torn about it. What to do. Right. Cause I hate that she's there feeling like that, but then I can't just bring her home two or three days every month. So we tried to bounce it out somehow.

Yeah. We're well, how do you, and what do you think about taking, starting the pill, doing birth control pills for it? Very flexible. Okay. Where are you going? Oh, do you want to talk to her? But I always talk to people. Emily is walking away. That's OK. Well, I mean, how do you I mean, how do you feel about it? It's you know, it's a it's a medication like anything else. Yes, it's used. You know, yes, it's used. No more period. Right. It's not no more period. Let's go. Less period. We could do less. You know, I think, you know, the you know, the the pills that we use where you take it three months and then are off of it for a week typically do real well.

You know, I'm all for having less periods, but it take it. It often takes a little bit to completely stop your period. You know, like you would need to do at least a few cycles of the three month periods before skipping those. I mean, that's not even that would just be the bonus job. I just don't want to be sad because then my friends are like, what's wrong with you? And it's really annoying. Oh, and then I am at camp. I always hear my period during camp. And then I think last year I had to go to I went to the nurse because my counselor saw me actually having a mental breakdown in the bathroom. But just go to the nurse and tell them you want to lay down. They're like they looked at me and they're like. You don't look sick, go back to your cabin. And so I started sobbing in the middle of the nurse's office in front of her. And they were like, OK, you can go lay down. Well, I mean, you know, like one one month, like she saw pictures of two different of her friend groups out, by the way.

She wasn't invited to either one. Right. And that is super sad and annoying. Right. But I think like she was already depleted, you know. And so from like being in that part of her life and then it was just one time, there is one at this episode, a song, a song that mom came upstairs and we had like a two hour conversation about how I feel that my outside family does not love me. It was really it was special. It was like it was. Yeah, she's just like I mean, she just finds things to like. I don't know. It's bizarre. But really, like I honestly, I was keeping a calendar. Like, seriously, I'll make this spreadsheet. Anyway, you're out of my style. Anyway, so, yes. So, I mean, there's so there's choices, you know, there's the take the pack for the month, have a period every month, take the three pack, you know, back to back where it comes as that. And then you have your period at the end of the three months. There's also a birth control patch instead of pills where you stick a patch on every week and you switch it out once a week and then you don't wear a patch for a week and you have a period.

Is it? That would sound so cool. I'll look like a cyborg. Well, you wear it or somebody doesn't see it. I think that's weird. She already takes pills in the morning anyway. But you've got to take the pack. Everybody's going to see it and they're going to be like, you know what is that? And you're going to have to say, no, I say no to that one. Well, that's like, what if you were like in softball or something and it comes off? I don't know. Yeah, sports makes it harder. The patch is really good when you know you will not remember to take it. You will not remember to take a pill. Oh, she'll know. Get it. in the morning, like everybody's meds laid out, the ADHD stuff, all that, everything. Um, I forgot to take my pill in the morning and my dad came to the championship game that night, it was at like seven o'clock at night, and he just pulled out my pill. Do you remember that? Such a twirl of bad. Nothing about you, there was nothing about you in that story directly. No, I mean, we like lay out the stuff in the morning, the PE clothes, the water bottles on the medications, we're like, good to go. So I think the patch is not good. I mean, she has super athletic, too many sports and stuff, I think it would be a mess. Yeah, that could be, that could definitely get, yeah, the patch is hard if you're super active, which, yes, yeah, yeah, if you're super sweaty all the time, yeah, then it's hard for it to be sticky.

Yeah. But otherwise, super sweaty all the time. And yeah, and if you already take pills every day, then that's not a big deal to remember to take a pill every day. The big thing with the pill is taking it at the same time every day. No, she said it doesn't, no, I was just wondering if that can explain it to you. Oh, transdermal? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. It's fine. It is cool. But no, I mean, the pills are fantastic. So why don't we, do you want to start with the three month one? You want to start with the three month one, right? If we can at least, I'm like, we can have, try to get a little bit of a bonus. Now the three month one, it is super important to take it at the same time every day and not skip. Because like all periods, you get a period because a period is hormone withdrawal. Like your body naturally, you know, your hormone levels plummet.

Part of, that's part of the, that's part of the emotional issues with your periods is your hormones plummet and that's why you bleed. So with the pills, I mean, really like eight in the morning versus 10 in the morning? No, not that close. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Morning versus afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yep. But yes. So skipping a pill, if you skip a pill, you could potentially start your period the next day. So I'm like, if your incentive is to make periods nicer, then take your period, you know, take the pill same time every day. All right. And what if, what if she misses one and she gets her period the next day, does she just keep taking it? Just keep taking it. Yeah.

No. Yeah. Okay. I mean, she shouldn't miss one. Cause like I said, I mean, really we have a whole pharmacy going on. And when you very first start the pill, you might, you know, you might spot and whatnot, you know, for the first, you know, pack. So just, you know, have some panty liners or whatever available so that you're not, you know, surprised. So I always have to wear a pad. That's up to you. Yeah. It should always have something with you just in case anywhere. Yeah. And then, you know, sometimes, you know, there could be a little headaches or, you know, nausea and that sort of thing. Typically that gets better. Doesn't birth control give you bigger boobs? No, not really. That's the last thing you need. She does not need bigger boobs. But sometimes if the nausea is not going away, then that's a reason that I would tell you to take it at night instead of in the morning. Okay. Cause often you can take it with like, you know, a cracker or something before bed. And then, you know, you sleep through it basically and so by the next morning you're you're better it's I mean it's just one of those things that we can we can work around it if if if if it's a thing okay otherwise sounds good yeah I mean let's otherwise let's try it um typically you'll start it kind of that Sunday after your period after your first period or after your next period um which could be this Sunday well there you go yeah ta-da right perfect okay any questions I don't know but nobody warned me about people like this yes she's fun she's fabulous exactly so now we just we just need to get the tears under control yeah we can do that yeah we can do that that would be great but that's that's hard to watch right well yeah well let me know obviously all right let me know all right you know um any any updates on Lily",,,

Yeah, I got laid off. Oh my goodness. In February, and I knew it was going to take a while, and it took like a year. Oh, I'm sorry. And you know what, I'm back.

Good, what are you doing now? Yeah, I'm working for this environmental consulting firm. It's good, it's a European company. Okay, so good work-life balance, I hope. Yeah, yeah. Because you know American companies don't do that. Yeah, compared to what I'm used to, I mean there's a lot to do, but it's not like, I feel like, you know, like, yeah.

Oh, for sure, for sure. Well, good thing is that your blood pressure looks great. And then, are you still taking the Pravastatin? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, because you know, my cholesterol, we decided that me trying to eat right and exercise wasn't enough, so. It wasn't too bad last year, but my question also for you is, what have you been doing for exercise and diet?

What I usually do, you know, I mean, getting to the gym when I can and then exercising around the house, running around the block. Okay. Working in my yard. Yeah. Yeah, doing what I, I mean, I could do more, but I'm conscious of it and then I still try to watch my diet as much as possible. Gotcha. What do you typically eat on a regular basis? Really boring, like chicken and vegetables and fish and vegetables and, you know, and then when I'm feeling super thin, you know, I'll have a little small bit of beef. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I treat myself to non-sulfite bacon every now and then. Okay, very good.

ulld then, are you still seeing your oncologist? No. Okay. No. What did they suggest or recommend? Well, after five years, they transition you out. Okay. Yeah, but you know, of course, mammograms. I did get a mammogram last October. Okay, good. But, you know, I mean, your health is really on you, you know, which I get people don't understand that. I know. It's the day-to-day choices, minimize stress, take care of yourself and pray for the best. It's true, it's true. Like, it's like no one's going to be at home to like make you do things, you know. And then people are like, oh, well, those doctors. And it's like, but you have to take care of yourself. Yeah, so I get it.

Yeah. I mean, it's fine. I did get my colonoscopy, thank God, the week. I got my colonoscopy like that Tuesday and I got laid off that Thursday. Oh, you be quiet. Yeah, so it was like, shh. How was that colonoscopy? It came back okay. I was concerned. Thank goodness, yeah. Because I had been, you know, just feeling bleh. And I think actually that medicine cleared me out that I had to take to get ready. But he said he wasn't concerned. He said five years. Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

I don't have the report. Who was the doctor? Um, Miller. Okay. Yeah, this is the one who had done it prior, but he didn't get a totally clear reading. I didn't do that medicine regimen very well. Oh, it's rough. Oh, it's so rough. So rough. My husband, he's had two because colon cancer runs in his family. I feel for him. Well, I've learned you have to start earlier than really what they say, yeah, because it's not that you're still pooping as you're at the end. Like rolling in there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just going to ask at your convenience afterwards, we'll just have you fill this out. So then that way I have it on file. But I do have your mammogram also.

It was done in September. So they will call you again and be like, hey, you know, Ms. Johnson, you need to get your mammogram. Yeah, yeah. And then just schedule. Because I, you know, I don't know if I had, you know, sometimes they have trouble reading and they have to take extra ones. I think it was OK, though, the one I did in September. It was. Yeah. Yeah. So age 54, you also are recommended to get the shingle shots. It looks like you got one in 2022. Do you know if you've had another one? No, and I think you had me get the one that I got. Yeah. Do you want the second one today? Yeah. OK. So we'll do that for you. Tetanus shots, you are up to date. OK. You've got blood work today, too. Well, I should, so you can look at my cholesterol. But I didn't have it this morning. I just came right here. Should I have gone there first? What, blood work? Yeah. Oh, no. Oh. Do it after. OK. Just because I have to put in the orders. Yeah. And I wouldn't have put in the orders. Yeah.

Yeah. So good. And then how's everything at home? Good. Who do you live with again? Remind me. Oh, no. I live in my cute little house. OK. Hello. OK. Good. Oh, I just sent your prescription to Lakeside Medical Center. OK. That's fine. That's OK. Yeah. Do you live in this area? No. I actually live in River Valley. So I slept here. Yeah. Because I first saw you when you were still on guest nurse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I liked you. So I said, you know what?

I'll make the drive. I'm sorry. Yeah. No. Because I know that commute sometimes can be pretty bad. But it was, I mean, there was more traffic at 9 o'clock than I thought there would be. But, you know, there's a lot of people. Yeah. It is a lot. A lot of people moved to Brookfield, too. They did. Yeah. Myself included. Yeah. What can I say? You like it? I love it. Yeah. I mean, I moved here while I was still at Heritage Town. Because I used to live in River Bend. And then, actually not too far from that pharmacy. But in the end, I was commuting. Yeah. For two years. And I had my screaming kids in the back of the car. Like, we got to do something here. Yes. My life, quality of life. Quality of life. Was like, I need to dump these kids off at home. And I need a mental break. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, things are so much better. And also, the kids are older now. That's good.

So we've definitely built our little niche here. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. I can't complain. I can't complain. Yeah. You get a nice house here, too. Nice house. It's so affordable. Because I'm not a fancy person. We don't have a huge house. And I'm like, oh my goodness. The houses I was looking over in that area were like 600. Yeah. And it was like 2,000 square feet. And I'm like, that's not enough space for my family. Exactly. So, no. We're great here. And I'm close to my mom. That's important.

Yeah. She's like 15 minutes east from here. Yeah. That's important. Yeah. So she loved to come over. And I felt bad. Because she would drive like 45 minutes to River Bend just to see her grandbabies. And I was like, oh. Yeah. Good. Happy. Mama. Happy. I like that. Exactly. Exactly. All right. You're doing over-the-counter lipid control, too? You know, I haven't done that in a while. OK. Yeah. I was just curious. Because, truthfully, I don't think you need it. I mean, if I'm taking the, yeah, so, yeah. I'm taking that off your list, then. Yeah, I think I might still have, like, so, a whole bottle of life extension, but I haven't taken it.

Yeah. Yeah, the lipid stuff, yeah. No. Because probac is it, it's better. Mm-hmm, it is. We'll see where it is at. I would say, if it's better, great. I won't change really anything. Because we started you on that about a year or two ago. Was that what it was? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you, when I sat with you, I guess it was 2022, because I missed you, actually. Mm-hmm. When I sat with you, it was still considered high, but you looked at the range, and you said it's getting better. Like, you looked at the trend. Mm-hmm. And you said it's getting better. Yeah. So, hopefully, the trend will... I would say, if it's too low, significantly lower, then I might say, hey, Alex, let's go ahead and either... What dose is it? Tens? Twenties. So, if anything, I may consider lower the dose to 10, and just repeat again in six months. I won't make you come this way. We can do a virtual visit, if you'd like. Okay. But just to compare. Sure. But if it's about the same, or just slightly better, then I'll just leave it at the 20. Okay, yeah. I don't see it being too low, but we'll see. I actually, the first week when I started my new job, they had an on-site health care. Okay, uh-huh. And they actually did... I should've brought it in. They did, they took some... They pricked me, and they did a test. But the thing was, I knew it wasn't accurate, because I didn't fast. Yeah. And it's a finger, so it's not as accurate, too. Yeah, and the fact that I didn't fast. So, of course, it came back high, but I was like, well, yeah, you know.

Yeah. And then I only capped that as... Ah, that's okay. That's okay. And that's why you're here, right? Good. What else do you been doing? Oh, you know, trying to socialize a little bit now that I'm, you know, got the weight of not, you know, having a full-time job. I always worked my little part-time job while I was looking, just to stay safe. Yeah. But, you know, the days fly by. They do. Yeah, they really do. They say days are long, years are short. Like, I still consider myself like a high school kid, and I'm definitely far from high school. In my mind, I still think like that. That's good. Yeah. And I have to forget. I'm like, wait, I'm grown with two kids. No.

I think the hardest thing for me is just kind of watching my parents age, because to me, they're still like in their 30s. And I'm like, wait a minute. Yeah. Have a seat here. It gets worse, too, because my mom is like 70, 80. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then I'm always harping at them, go see your doctor, and they won't do it. At least my dad. I'm like, thanks. Good. And then deep breath. And again. Last one. Good. Listen to your stomach. Perfect. Are you sexually active?

Slightly. Slightly. STD screening? Well, I'm gonna go get my pap and my STD. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I was like, I'm drawing blood, let me know, that way I can order it all at the same time. Oh, yeah, you know what? You might as well. Okay. Yeah. Okay, go ahead and lie down for me. That way, whenever you go see your gyn, she'll be like, oh, my doctor already screened for STDs. So then that way she doesn't have to add on more. Yeah. Okay. I'm, of course, hungry, so you're growling. Oh, me too. I never, now that you've said that, I was like, oh. Do you want me to have your breakfast? No. I was like, I got a breakfast taco in my, we hide it in the thing. Oh, yeah, you haven't had a chance to eat it. Nope. I'll probably end up being my lunch. No worries. But, okay, let's do that. And then, with you being sexually active, are you using condoms consistently? Mm-hmm. Okay, good. Just, I just want to make sure you're safe. Yeah. Now, if you're in a monogamous relationship, both partners are, you know, free of STDs, then sure. Yeah. If not. No, I get it. I know. And even sometimes when you think you're in a monogamous relationship, turns out, oops. It's true. There's a one way. Yeah. I've lived long enough to. Yeah. And truthfully, it is, I want whatever that's, you know, some people are okay with it and some people are not. Mm-hmm. It doesn't matter to me. I just want you to be healthy. Yeah, exactly.

Now, you know, healthy mind too, so. Yes. All right. Any questions for me? No. Okay. I love seeing you again. I know. It's great to see you. You have a very comforting way about you. Oh, well, that's good to hear. I don't hear that too often. I feel like I'm always kind of like. Well, you're, you know, you're the quarterback. You have to, you know, are you doing this? Are you doing that? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. If you ever find that this is too far, I understand completely. I've had quite a few patients follow and over the course of time, I kind of have to boot them because they're a little bit older. And then they can't really drive very well. And I'm like, you need to go back to Heritage Town. I have some great doctors still there, so just let me know. I love all of them. Okay. So I think you'll be in good hands either way. Okay. Okay? And I know you've mentioned that when I was here before. Oh, I did? Okay. Yeah, because you were like, I know it's far, but, you know, for now, again, I don't see you that often. Yeah. If I could work my schedule, you know, it's fine. Yeah. Once a year, not too bad. It's my older patients where they were like seeing me every three months. Oh, yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. And then, you know, when it rains. Well, that's the worst. Yes. That's the worst. I just tell them, cancel the appointment. It's okay. Cancel it. I don't need you risking your life. Yeah, because people are not kind drivers. That's the problem. No, they're not. They're not. And I also find that after COVID, a lot of people are not very kind, period. No, no. But their personalities really show on the road. They do.

ulld, you know what I mean? And it's like, where are you going? Why do you have to run us all over to say 20 seconds? And then you're just going to be right there at the light. Yeah. It's like, sucker. I know. Oh, my goodness. Too funny. Okay, Alex, it's so good seeing you. If you can, go ahead and let's fill out these forms. Okay. And then she will bring your vaccine and your papers shortly. Okay. And do you remember where to go for your blood work? I do. It's right across. No, it's right here between us and the ER. Oh. So you're not going to leave this building. Well, oh, okay. When I come in the door, instead of making a right to come into your office, I make a left. That's where I remember doing it before, right? Yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay. I got it. Okay. So take these outside. No, you can finish it right here. Yeah, finish right here. All right, take care now. Drive safely. Bye-bye, Miss Davis. All the way up to the front, yes ma'am. Have a good day.",,,
c6a540fe-a678-4ff9-9125-649cd47ef8fa,,,,,F32.9 Major depressive disorder,"Taking tools I'm using, like I use it for my new patients, establishing care, follow-up visits, things like that. So I'm using that today to help me out if that's okay. Yeah. So tell me a little bit about you and what brings you in. So I have, You were actually referred to me by my best friend. She comes to you. She loves you. Oh, yeah. What's her name? Jamie Evans. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, wonderful. Tell her I say thank you and hello. Yeah, yeah, of course.

So I have been on like an antidepressant for since I was like 16 years old. Okay. And you know I've tried different ones and then I was on Lexapro I think maybe like the longest. Okay. And then I just felt like it wasn't really working that well for me. So I went to my other primary care physician. Yeah. It's now been maybe like a year and a half. Okay. If not longer. And she switched me to Trintellix. Okay. And I mean, it works fine. It's... you know, I feel like it's doing its job, but we're talking, my boyfriend and I have been together for like six years now, and we're talking about potentially starting a family. Yeah. And I read that like Trintellix is not one of the good ones to be on like pregnullt, and I just knowing myself, I've don't think that I could be without something. Yeah. I, you know, I get very depressed, I go kind of into like hiding or I just don't want to get out of bed, I, you know, very easy to cry and think like the world is ending. Yeah. So, I don't think like coming off of something is an option. Yeah, for sure. So I want to just explore what I can be on and be pregnullt and just starting a family.

Definitely, definitely. No, I'm glad you brought that up. What do you do for work, Ashley? I work in HR and compensation. Okay. Okay, awesome. What sector? Chemicals. I work for North Vale Hospital right out on I-10. Okay, cool. Is it stressful work? No, no. I mean, it ebbs and flows. Sure. Sometimes it is. Other times I'm like, like today, I'm like, okay, I'm just going to take it easy for the rest of the week. Oh, good, good, good, good. I'm glad. Yeah, I mean, the topic sounds stressful, right? But, you know, I'm glad that maybe it's not always stressful. No, no.

ulld you're not taking Lexapro at all anymore, or are you still taking the 10 milligrams? I am not taking Lexapro, I'm taking the Trintellix. Okay. At the moment, 10 milligrams. Okay. And you said it's been a couple years? I think so, I think it's been- And you just felt like the Lexapro wasn't- maximizing, like it wasn't giving you all the benefits. Correct and I know sometimes if you're on something for a long time you build up kind of a resistance to it so I don't know if maybe now going back and doing it again it would work again, it was just, I just felt like it wasn't, I start, I It's not getting, like, I think the most out of it. Yeah. So, yeah, and there isn't really, like, a true tolerance that's built up, I will say that. It's typically- Typically, it's typically kind of the psychological dependence and then just kind of like When we look pharmacologically at the medication, we generally don't. Now, every once in a while we do, but usually we'll say, if a medication works for you, you can stay on it long-term, it's safe. it should be effective. If you come off of the medication, we need to restart you. If we need one that works well for you, you can go back on that one. So with SSRIs, that's kind of how they work. Other medications and other, you know, disease conditions, a little different. But, I mean, what I would consider is, If you're really trying to find one that's safe for pregnullcy and that's effective, most studies have been done on Prozac or fluoxetine. Fluoxetine and Lexapro, same class of drug, so very, very close, whereas Trintellix is slightly different. It's still kind of in that class. I think technically, I'm going to double check here, but it's one of our newer meds, so it just, yeah, has a little bit of a different effect, but I really like, my go-to for my, you know, 20 to 50 year olds. um, for major depression is fluoxetine. Um, I think it's really effective, um, and it has like a faster activating capability than some of the other SSRIs, um, and has the most- studies done around it for pregnullcy too. Okay. So I mean Lexapro also safe, very safe.

That would make me feel comfortable, it's like knowing that I could be on something. Yeah. That has backing or research done behind it. Yeah, exactly. So, let me see here. So that's what I would try and what I would probably do is have you wean off of the Trintellix while you're getting on the fluoxetine. Okay. So if you're on a 10 milligram tablet just cut it in half and take that for about 2 weeks and then you could come off of it completely. they do work in the same class of drug so one thing that I want you to look out for would be any sort of like like Let me see. I want to see if we have a handout on it, but it's called like serotonin syndrome. It is very rare that it happens, but sometimes it can happen when you have too much circulating serotonin in your system. If that were to happen, what you would do is just stop the medication that you're, you know, on immediately. I would stop both of them. Again, I've never seen this happen. Okay. So this is like. She wants serotonin, sounds like I'd be like floating on it. Yeah, I mean you would know it. I'll give you a handout that kind of talks through. um what what that would look like just so you kind of have an idea. Um but I don't want you to think oh she's telling me this because it's going to happen this is like textbook yeah very very precautionary. So would I take half the Trintellix and then half The fluox, whatever, how would you pronounce it? Yeah, the fluoxetine. So what you would do is, 10 is kind of our starting dose for fluoxetine. So I'd have you take 5 while you're on 5 and then you come. off of the Trintellix and go to 10 of the fluoxetine and then I'd love to meet with you maybe in about two to four weeks and we can do that virtually through the portal and we can just talk through how things are going and if we need to make adjustments we may need to increase the fluoxetine, but this gives us enough time because it does take four to six weeks to take effect, but the fluoxetine generally starts working a little bit earlier than that. Okay. handout that I'm giving you has got, you know, the signs of serotonin syndrome, but really it's like you would know, you would be like something's off, vomiting, diarrhea, like you'd have, you know, really fast breathing, shivering, shaking, sweating, like extreme, not like anxiety related, like.

Withdrawals. Yes, yes. And then my other question for you, are you doing counseling? I am not. Okay, are you interested? I am. I was going to somebody before like just like a therapist talk to talk and she was like okay well I don't think you need me anymore and you know how hard it's so hard to find a therapist yeah so I'm showing you that because we've got this collaborative care program here that is really helpful um for access. It's a virtual opportunity to meet with somebody. They only do virtual right now, but what's nice is my front desk can set you up, give you the cost information. Everything and everything's shared in the chart. Like when I say collaboration, it's truly like I've met them. I am constantly in communication with them through the chart. There is a psychiatrist who's available if we want them to make any medication recommendations, which might be nice if. let's say we go down this road, we try the fluoxetine, it doesn't work, maybe we want some other options that are safe during pregnullcy, but yeah, what I like about them is just their collaboration with us, and then the easy access, and They do graduate you from the program.

Mm-hmm. Okay, it's not like a long-term program, but they will send you off with resources. Okay. That are most appropriate based on how you do. This is what- Taylor was telling me about this. Okay, wonderful. She's like, this is amazing. Oh, good. She loves it so much, so. Oh, that's so good to hear. I would definitely be interested, for sure. Yeah, so let me, I'll give you a couple things. I'll give you, like, an informational handout, but you could even just, like, trial, Like trial and a visit and my front desk can sit you up so like you can kind of talk that through with them if you'd like. Okay. And then that would be nice what we could do is we can do a virtual visit in like two to four weeks and we'll I'll be able to review those notes before then too.

Perfect. So. Yeah, I would say it's kind of a nice, nice touch. Yeah, no, that's really, that's really cool. So the Trintellix we talked about. How long does that take to like fully come out of your system? It's in that same class of drugs as the other SSRI, as fluoxetine, so I'm gonna say generally four to six weeks. Okay. Yeah. I'm not trying to have a baby like tomorrow. Yes. It's just, if it was like six months or something long term that I need to see another- Yeah, no, I mean, really about four to six weeks, yeah. Thank you. So yeah so you're gonna and I wrote the instructions in the paperwork too but essentially you're gonna be on 5 of both of them and then you're gonna be on 10 of the Prozac and then like if our Appointment is like in, you know, 2 to 4 weeks or whenever it is. In between that, if you have any questions or anything comes up, you can always message me. Okay. So, you know, if you're like, oh, I feel like nothing's really happening. Now, give it about 2 weeks. Yeah. To even feel any effect. And remember, I'm putting you on below the starting dose. just to kind of get your body used to it and get, get, because you're already having some serotonin in your system from the Trintellix, I don't want it to become an overdose of that. So, so yeah, so I mean, you may not notice anything for about two to three weeks, but I think you'll probably, you should feel the same because we're still Tapering you down from the Trintellix.

COVID flu shots, have you had those in the last couple years? I think I got the flu shot last year, I don't remember. Okay. But no, not, I mean not recently, not this year yet. And then have you had any of the COVID shots? I did. I did the, what was the, it was a Mirena. No. Moderna. Moderna Mirena. Yes. Moderna. Yes. Okay. The double, the two, but I didn't do any boosters after that. After the first ones. Okay. I had COVID like twice. already, even with the shot, so it wasn't terrible.

Yeah, I mean, I know it's our first time meeting, I will always counsel on vaccines. Yeah. Just their importance. You want me to pop up here? Yes, that would be great. And I'm not opposed, I'm just- and lazy. Yeah, yeah. Because it knocks you, it knocks it out of you over time. It does. So I like hate to. Lately it's been better, I will say, and I think it's kind of sadly because we just, we I have so much fun surgery. Seems like everybody's getting it again all of a sudden too. Yes. Here, let's follow the point. Thank you. Okay, perfect, you can have it. Well, it's lovely to meet you, Blake. It's nice to meet you as well, thank you so much. I look forward to working with you. I think of myself kind of as your healthcare coach, your healthcare advocate. Yeah. You know, you've got- busy, busy life, I'm sure, and I just want to make it easy for you to coordinate that health, so. Thank you, I appreciate it. Use that portal to stay in touch. I think the collaborative care, there's a convenience factor there, too, that's really nice, and then, let's see if, Some of these medications and the changes are effective for you and then also kind of offer you a safer, more evidence-based option for family planning.

Thank you so much. Yeah. So should I talk to your front desk then about? Yeah, so there, actually, before you head there, I'm going to get you just a little information. The front desk will be the ones to set you up with me and with the- program and then they're going to give you a little visit summary that I mentioned about just some of those things to look out for. Perfect. Okay, thank you. Have a good one. Okay.",,,
d0063b10-a546-490a-ad50-fb6fb3347bbe,18.0,year,female,FM ESTABLISHED PATIENT,"F41.1 Generalized anxiety disorder
J42 Chronic bronchitis","How are you? Hi, good, how are you? Good, you look tired. I am tired. Do you have like kind of a cold? I have bronchitis. Oh, do you? Mm-hmm. How long have you been dealing with that? 3 and a half months. Like the whole time you've been down there basically? Yeah. Or up there? Yeah. And then I came back here and went to the urgent care and I was like, no one, no one's going to stop me. And they said, no one can help you, you're broken. Oh, man. Yeah.

That's miserable, yeah, I guess actually I see here, you did have a chest x-ray, huh? Yeah. Did those little Clarigel pills, the benzonate Tessalon Perles, do they help at all? Maybe a little bit. What about the albuterol? I don't know if I can tell a difference with it. Okay. But I don't know if that just gets I'm not using it enough or. Okay, well, I'm sorry. No, it's okay, just got to tough it out.

ullna, I was hoping this would be better. I thought it was. Well, I was hoping to be better than it is. Oh. I mean, let's see, I'm seeing, yeah, because it is better. So I don't know if you remember your score last time with this top one, it was 20. Mm-hmm. And this time, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11. So I guess it is half. Yeah. I guess actually that is better than I was thinking, and last time this one was 18. This is the one that I don't think changed as much. Your GAD score is 12, 14, 16. So yeah, that anxiety part isn't quite as. Yeah.

Do you feel like, yeah, I. I feel like that's, I feel like that's true. That's true. Yeah. Have you had any issues with the Cymbalta? I don't think so. Okay. I mean, I don't see it helping, like, my sleep or my appetite, which is hard. What did your weight do? You've, well, I don't know, you're the same as August. Yeah. Basically, up a pound, but you're down a little bit from February when you were at Speedy Health, I don't know if you had, you have like a coat and everything on, I don't even know if you remember when you got weighed in there. No. Okay.

I had shorts on then. Okay. So from a treatment standpoint, it's very reasonable to consider increasing your dose to 60 milligrams. Okay. So that dose goes up to 120. Mm-hmm. And so it very well could be that we'd be able to lower even more that top part, the PHQ score, lower than 11, and hopefully it would help more with the anxiety component too. Okay. What do you think? Yeah, that's great. But... We're in a positive direction at least, right? Mm-hmm, I think we are, yeah.

How's school? It's good, yeah, I'm doing well, but I don't know the social aspect of it, it's hard. What's hard with it? I literally have no friends. That's what you said last time, it upackles my mind. Yeah, I have literally no friends. I think it might just be because I'm very different than the people up there, like I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke, I don't, you know? Yeah. And so then it's just kind of like... The people who do that just don't really click with me. Man. So I just let them spend all my time at the gym.

Yeah. That's all I do. Yeah. I mean, spending time at the gym is good, but we don't want you like deep diving into exercises. Yeah. It's my only couple of months. Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. So will roommates change at all at the semester? Mm-hmm. Yeah. You'll get new ones? Yeah, which should be good because I really struggle with my roommates this semester. Yeah. Man, I'm sure your mom's saying the same thing. Yeah, I don't know if it's just like an adjustment period thing, but I feel like I've had a lot of time to adjust up there. Yeah. Hmm.

What, like, are you doing any sort of, like, extracurricular activity kind of like things? Yeah. I work, so I work at the finullcial aid office. Mm-hmm. Probably about 15 hours a week. Mm-hmm. And then I'm like a treasurer of a club. What club? The Apparel, Textiles, and Design Club. Okay. So we just like do crafts and stuff. Yeah, that's cool. It's good, yeah. And then, trying to think of what else, I have a position in our house next year. Mm-hmm. So I'm like finullcial chair. Mm, okay. So that should be stressful. Mm-hmm. Man, yeah, I don't know.

I know this is completely. Am I like broken? How do I fix this? No, that's what I was just going to say. I was going to say, I mean, I know this probably has very little impact, but it blows my mind. Yeah. Because it totally seems like you would just have a million friends and everybody would love you. That's how I would feel too. Yes. Which is not like me trying to be cocky or whatever. No. I feel like it would be so easy for me. Yes. Yeah. And so. It's rough. With school. I mean, because you're wanting to do that kind of design stuff, apparel, and that's the school that has the program, or? Yeah, so they have a program that I really like, but I think I might do two years there and then, like, transfer to, like, State College Clinic. Uh-huh.

Because they have the same. They do. One, and they have a really good abroad program for it. Man. And so, I don't know. I don't even know if I would know, are you active with the church? Depends. Depends? I feel like. Would that be hard to go to State College Clinic? I don't think so, but I go to church up in Athens. Uh-huh. But I just don't go to the LDS church, I go to like a Christian church. Yeah, uh-huh. I don't know, I think it's like the actual going to church part that's hard, not like the gospel. Yeah. But. Okay. I don't know. I know that with your mom there's some love and hate there.

There is. Mm-hmm. I think I'm pretty much just like my mom, like love and hate with it, so. Yeah. But I'm pretty sure they think we're inactive because they like came and like sang at our door the other day. Oh, did they? And I was like, oh shoot. Sorry. I was like, we're the new project. Yeah. Yeah, no, I don't know. I mean, I don't comprehend. I mean, how it wouldn't be that you'd just be like... You know, finding the click and finding friends and stuff. I think it's hard because I have really like strict boundaries that I keep up and some people just don't like that. Mm-hmm. But. Man, well I hope that the change in roommates is a positive one and is good. I hope so too. Mm-hmm. Yeah, actually I found out today who I'm rooming with.

Oh, okay. That'll be good. Good. So let me just double check pharmacy, Green Pharmacy and Dual Health Center. Yeah. Right? So since we're kind of in the right track, do you want me to send this over as a 90 day supply so you get more at a time when you pick it up? Sure, yeah. Okay. And then, I mean, since we're in the right direction and we're kind of bumping up the dose, I'm less like, oh, let's check back in 5, 6 weeks. If you want, we can, but if you're like, okay. Let's give it longer and just kind of see how things go. Okay. Yeah, we can do that. What do you think? Do you have a time frame at all that you would want to? Like 6 months? 3 months? I would say like 3. 3?

ulld so 3 months is December. Will you be coming home for, you probably have no idea what you'll be doing for spring break, huh? I don't think I'll be home for spring break, yeah. Okay, so a video visit would be probably easiest? Yeah. Do you know when your spring break is? Mm-hmm, yes, my spring break is I think it's the 10th through the 14th. Oh, that's early. Mm-hmm. So maybe we do it the week after that so you know that you're back. Yeah. Because if you're going somewhere fun, you're not going to be. like. Yeah, it's true. You'll be like, oh crap, I missed my appointment, you know? No, it's true. Yeah. Okay, and I'll put video visit. Okay. Do you have an idea of something that you're going to do for spring break?

Or just, you want to do something? I think I might have an idea of what we're doing. I have a friend who's like in the dorms. Mm-hmm. So we don't really hang out a lot, but She wants to go to Jackson and just stay at her parents' cabin. That's cool. That'd be awesome. So it might just be fun to just get out. Yeah. And like our sorority is stupid and closes off like all of our housing. So even if we wanted to just like stay there, we can't. Are you serious? Have you, so I guess, yeah, tell me how it's been in the sorority. I don't. Love it, but I don't hate it. Like, I think I like it more than I would have liked being in the dorms. Okay. But I hate it. Do you think next year you'll stay with that? Or do you think you'll just try to find a house with some friends maybe?

Or it's too early to tell? I don't know. I think it is too early to tell. Just because next year would be really fun because that's when like, you're the older one and it's not like you're being bullied the whole time, you know? Don't let them do bad stuff to you, right? Literally. I mean, there's news articles all the time about crazy stuff. Literally, and so I think the only, I think the reason why I think I hate it is because there's just so much peer pressure and people just don't listen to your boundaries. Yeah. And so then when you actually stand up for yourself, people think you're mean. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm not mean, I just don't want to drink. I don't know why that's so hard for you to comprehend. So, I mean also, it's hard being sober at the college that is. A little more of a party school? Yeah, just because you're always driving people around, and people are always throwing up in your car. Yes. Here, please hold my hair. Literally. Yeah, it's just rough, but.

Yeah. But all will be well, this is temporary. That's right. That's a good mentality to have with it. I feel like if I say it enough, I'm going to start to bleed back. It is true, it is. Yeah, so actually after I looked at the quick care, I can see that in Autumn you were seen down in, I forget what, Grim, Cityside Rapid Health? That's the name of their quick care? Yeah. Okay. They're trash. Yeah. They're not good. And they gave you prednisone, and then they actually did, oh, did you have a. I went twice I think. Yeah, the other one, I'm trying to see what they gave you then. Oh, they gave you amoxicillin, huh? Yeah. Do you need more of those clear gel pills or do you feel like it's not worth my money? I don't think it's doing anything. Okay.

Let me have you come up here. I'll just listen to your lungs, make sure nothing's changed from the [inaudible]. It's bad though. I've had it for forever. I think that might be the reason why I'm like not sleeping. You're not like having allergy like symptoms though either, are you like sneezing and throat itchy or anything like that? No, it's literally just the cough, like I literally cough, this is way gross, but I cough so hard that I'll throw up. Yeah. Like it's so bad. Okay. I don't know how to fix it. Take a deep breath, okay, out. Everything seems to be moving good. Deep breath. -better worse, I'm sorry. It's okay. Sounds like you're moving well. It's the worst. Yeah. Because I go in and they're like, no, you're fine. If you hadn't done that prednisone, I would have said, hey, that's worth trying. So prednisone, you know what that is? It's like a strong anti-inflammatory that sometimes it's like, okay, you've cleared the infection, but there's just kind of still inflammation there. And so that will calm it down, but you already tried that. Yeah, I feel like I try medication and it works for like 2 days and then I'm just back. And then you're back. Like, will it ever go away? I don't know. It will, it will. It's just slow. You didn't have asthma or anything when you were younger, right? Mm-mm. Or RSV? Like, when you were a baby? No. Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Things can only get better. That's right. Things can only get better from here, so. Yes. Okay, questions about anything else? I was going to ask, I know that my mom takes like a booster medication. Mm-hmm, for anxiety? Mm-hmm. BuSpar, does that sound familiar? Probably, yeah. And I don't know if that would be better than like boosting my medication. Boosting it up? I should just. It's a Wellbutrin, it's a different one. I would do this first. Okay. And that would be, I'll make a note here, consider, so the downside of Wellbutrin, that for you, most people are loving this possibility, Wellbutrin can actually make you lose weight. Oh, okay. And so that's kind of a, I mean. So maybe. We're not trying to have you gain 20 pounds, but at the same time, we're not trying to help you lose 7, 8 pounds. Right. And so. Yeah. -probably would say, yeah, that's a decent still option, but I would for sure try to increase it and build the first one. Okay, perfect. So, other questions? No. Okay, any exciting things with this visit down? You're going to go skiing? You're going to go? I'm hoping that I'll go skiing once or twice. Yeah. But I'm just working, so. Oh, you're working since you're back here? Yeah, I work. At the car shop? No, I work at the Santa booth. Oh, with Henry Clark? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've done it for like 4 years. Do you know Jordan then? Uh-huh. Jordan's my niece. Really? Yeah.",,,
98d57afa-9f06-44a6-b1be-bfa5c3438464,71.0,year,male,ESTABLISHED PATIENT,I50.9 Chronic heart failure,"Hey, how are you guys? Pretty good, how about you? Oh, pretty good. Good, good, good. Alright. Yeah, it never stops around here. All these people moved in, they didn't bring any doctors with them, so we're busy. He's going to need his Eliquis refilled. Okay. And I told the nurse to have it sent over to Walmart and Marcus, because we're having problems with R&R saying they fax for new prescriptions, but 4 days later they said, oh, we're still waiting for the doctor. So I end up having to call the office to let them know and they have to rush try to get it over because he's out. Okay. I'm tired of their ringing around like I don't know if they're actually not faxing the information over or their information is not connecting over. So it's just getting, and I go, it's funny Walmart don't have that problem. because I called him like two day before yesterday and let him know and So I don't know if you got anything on it. Okay, Walmart drone. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's, there's all weird stuff all the time, so. Well, I've been having to call the primary doctor every time on his medications, on his other ones. Okay. Because then four days later, they go, well, we're still waiting for the doctor. They'll check. They never even got the facts to them. So I just, well, R&R in Durham, they got a lot of high school kids that are on the job training and stuff like that too, so. Yeah.

Okay, so your blood pressure's been running low, huh? Yeah. Emily Simpson, diabetic doctor, tachymopoulosartan for the time being. Yeah. Are you retaining any water? Sometimes, not real bad, but he's on a suprapubic catheter now. Okay, but are we swelling in the legs? Sometimes. Because- the, if we're, if our blood pressure's dropped that might be a sign that we've dried him out too much. Right. And so then we'd have to cut back on the water pill a bit. Okay. So, his weight's been, did they weigh him? No, because he can't stand on his hands. Oh, okay. He's too weak to do that. Okay. That makes it trickier. Yeah, his ankles kind of swell up a little bit. Are they swollen today? Well, there's no one you can tell. Okay. Hold your leg out so you can see. This one. Okay. Which also make him elevate a lot.

Are you still on Flomax then? Yes. Do they want you still on it? If you have a suprapraetic catheter, you shouldn't need it. I don't know if they didn't tell us to take it off. The new urologist is Turner. He goes to see him tomorrow. Okay. So I'll ask him. Yeah, because if we don't need that, that'll help with his blood, bring his blood pressure up because he's on two pills. Right. And let's see.

Yeah, his bladder is holding. 600 liters of urine I was not putting out. So they had Dr. Brown, urologist, PA's assistants, put a catheter in a week later, They had to go in and do surgery, put a super- -pubic because they put it in wrong and ripped him. Yeah, that's good enough. So now he's got to have surgery again for that. Okay, are they planning on keeping the suprapubic in there? So far, because they found no blockage or anything that's not allowing it to. train. And I think he has an infection because kidney doctor gave him some antibiotics because it showed on his chart whoever took the last blood work on him showed he's had an infection for a month. And that, no one contacted me or primary doctor or the urologist, so the kidney doctor put him on medication for 2 weeks, she wanted him in after the 20th of May, but the next day they wanted to get him in, and I said no, it has to be after the 20th, he just started those. Yeah. And nobody had any openings so he sees a urologist tomorrow. Okay. Because he's out of it and I noticed a urine smell. Yeah, those are tricky because when you have the catheter, you can get bacteria in it that's not really infected, so it's hard to know the difference, but they'll know tomorrow. Yeah, because sometimes I just smell it when I'm this far away from it. Yeah. And they said it showed that he had an infection for a month and not been treated, and they're surprised he hasn't gone septic like he usually does. He sleeps quite a bit too, so.

Okay, well heart wise I think things look okay, I would just check with them, see if we can get them off the Flomax, that might help the blood pressure go back up to normal. Okay. And so I'll talk to them about that tomorrow, but. Okay. Otherwise, heart-wise, I think we're on good medicine, things look good as far as I'm concerned, so, see you in six months. All right, that makes it nice, good job, it's a battle, he wants salt, he wants hot dogs, he wants, no, you can't have them. Doctor says no. Full assault. I said doctor said no. Oh, got your toe. Oh, got my shoe. Okay, to the left. And I'll get you checked out right up there at the front. All right. We'll see you later. Yeah, thank you. Mm-hmm.",,,

Z83.3 Family history of diabetes mellitus","Oh. Hey. Emily? Yes. Dr. Johnson, nice to meet you. Hello. And? Sophia. Sophia. And this is your son? Yeah, Ethan. Ethan, all right. Hi. All right, Emily, welcome to our clinic.

Are you new to the area or new to our clinic? Like, have you been seen elsewhere? No, I really don't get seen. I think last time I got saw, seen. Was in Caldwell, somewhere in Caldwell, when I was 18. Okay, all right.

So overall, you feel that you're healthy. I heard you have some concerns, but at least you're not taking any daily medication for chronic non-medical issues, right? Okay. And, okay, what concerns you have today?

Well, for a while I've had this bump right here on my chest. Okay. I mean, it's painful here and there. We might think it's a hernia, but. When did you notice that bump? How long ago? I don't know, it's really, probably 4 years, 5 years ago. 4 or 5 years ago, and it's right in the. It feels like right dead center, like right there. Right in the center, at the bottom of your sternum, okay.

Is that like POPs? Sometimes, I mean, but I feel like it's like a bone though, but like I press on it, and like. I could hear like pops up. You can hear pop, okay. Yeah, there's a, oh, sorry. No, no, go ahead. There was sometimes where I tried to sleep on my side and it was like bothering me, so. Okay, all right, and do you feel it's on the bone, on the cartilage, like the end of the sternum? I feel like it is on the end. Okay, yeah. Yeah, so. That's sometimes just a piece of the sternum, the end of the sternum, it's the cartilage. That sometimes, just like any other joint, can get tender, can get inflamed or sprained. The more weight of the abdomen, the large size of the abdomen, and especially when you sit down, and all of this abdominal fat will push against it, okay?

So. I did gain weight 5 years ago. All right, let me just feel it here. Right here? Mm-hmm. Yeah, this is just part of the sternum. I can pull up a picture and show it to you. So if you lose a little bit of weight here and here, you will have less of pressure. Okay, all right, so that's an easy fix.

What else? My dad got, he's been diagnosed with diabetes. Your father diagnosed with diabetes. How old is he? I think he's 50 plus. I'm up 30. They had me at 23, I think it's 53 or under. 53, so it's type 2 diabetes. Yes. Okay, all right. And we're just concerned with him, maybe like pre-diabetes or anything, because he's had some signs and we just want to make sure.

What are the signs? Well, he says he gets tired sometimes, sometimes he'll have like anxieties. And it was like, he's been getting more of like those. Dark skin? Skin tags? The skin tags. Skin tags, oh, okay. They've been coming out more here around like his eye area. Okay. And then. In the armpit area too, I know that right. Oh, yeah, in the armpit area too. Yeah. That could be like from friction or something. Yeah, yeah. Okay, any darker skin in your armpit?

Yeah. Let me see. Yeah. This is why you're in those. [inaudible] but not too dark. Not too dark. Oh, like, you're talking like black, dark? Yeah, like a brown, darker brown. Yeah, I don't see that. Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean, generally, I mean, those kind of like the frecklings, those are benign. Don't worry. Those are not signs of diabetes, but usually what we call it acanthiosis, or like a dark brown, bronze skin changes in the armpit, under the breast, sometimes around the neck. We see that those are Yeah, sometimes signs of like diabetes or insulin resistance, I would say. So family history of type 2 diabetes, yes, would put you at risk, but that does not mean that you will develop diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, it is not an insulin production issue, not like type 1, people like will born with it. Type 2 usually comes from bad life choices, eating the wrong food, being sedentary, not exercising, not managing our lifestyle, all of that can get you into type 2 diabetes because your body will have resistance to insulin because you have load of sugar, load of processed carbohydrates, and all of that, if you're not active, not exercising, will be stored inside the body and put a stress not only in your pancreas, but also on the liver, okay?

So, medically speaking, your BMI is 33, so med- Medically speaking, we call that, this will put you at increased risk for metabolic dysfunction syndrome, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, fatty liver, okay? Have you noticed him snoring at night loudly or choking and you need kind of like to give him like an elbow and make him kind of like wake up and breathe or change his position? I noticed the snoring, I haven't noticed him, I guess there's been a couple times where it's been like snoring, then he'll like stop, and then kind of like a loud snore after that. Okay, yeah, so this is apnea, this is apneic episodes, and usually snoring comes from like heavy weight around the neck, and usually when we sleep, our neck muscles, tongue muscles, all of that will relax and it will drop back. And if there is an extra weight from fat around the neck, this will make that even further, kind of like a drop, and it will block the airway, and that's how people snore. Do you feel, when you wake up in the morning, you feel refreshed, like you have a good restful night's sleep? Or you feel tired? Or in the afternoon, do you feel like you're zoning out and you may need to have a nap?

Okay. Yeah. Is there a family history of sleep apnea? Do you know? Not that they've gotten checked. Okay, so that's okay. So. I know the diabetes his dad and then his grandpa as well. Okay. Has passed away. From diabetes? What about stroke, heart disease, high blood pressure? That I know of. Okay. I don't have a stroke, I don't have high diabetes. Okay, and no heart disease? No.

Okay, colon cancer? No. Okay. All right, so. And I see your blood pressure is elevated, 165 over 80. When was the last time you checked your blood pressure? Like, 2 months ago? A couple months ago, like at the Walmart, you know? Uh-huh. And then I think in the beginning of this year, we had taken him for his heart appointment. They checked me, I just told them. And then they checked his, and it was pretty high. I told the nurse just to check my blood pressure. Okay, and also was high? Yeah, every time I go, it's high. Okay, well, yeah, so do you guys have a blood pressure monitor at home? No. Yeah, I usually, and this is kind of like not my cell, but usually we don't make judgment or diagnosis on a one time or a 2-time high blood pressure readings in a medical office or like at a pharmacy, at a store. It's just because always we consider like this white coat syndrome, like today you're meeting a doctor for the first time, there's a list of concerns, you guys have been talking about it and preparing and that's probably raised some stress and anxiety. The best way to diagnose high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure monitoring at home. So, you just need to buy an arm cuff blood pressure monitor, it doesn't have to be expensive or fancy, any simple basic one, okay? And just check the blood pressure at the same time of the day, every day, for at least a week, and make sure it is not right when you come off of work or right when you have some stressful events or news. You need to be relaxed, you need to sit empty your bladder, kind of like can take a picture to disapproach her, this is the right way how to check the blood pressure, you need to sit upright, feet on the ground, empty bladder, take a few relaxation, deep breaths, don't talk to anyone, and then check the blood pressure. And if we do this the right way and just follow up with you, and then I will review those like 7 blood pressure readings, and then we'll average them. Our target number is less than 135 over 85 with home monitoring. If all of your readings are in this range under 135 over 85 with home monitoring, then you don't have high blood pressure. If it is 135 over 85 or higher, then yes, you do have high blood pressure.

Do you have risk right now to develop high blood pressure? The answer is yes. If we don't take care of your weight, if you don't change your lifestyle, and most importantly, exercising, losing weight, eating healthy, then the likelihood of having high blood pressure in the future will be very high. Also, we need to really find out if you have a sleep apnea or not. And this is what I will order. I will order a home sleep study. So you will do it in your home, in your bed. Make sure you pick a night where the next day you don't need to go to work, you don't have anything important to do. So you have like your normal, regular, relaxed sleep. And this way we will see if you have a sleep apnea or not. Now, if you have a sleep apnea and it's because of the snoring, I mean, the best way to lose weight, positional changes, we can, if you don't want the CPAP, it depends on how severe it is, how bad is it. Sometimes you may need to use the CPAP until you take care of like your body weight and other issues, okay? And just to rule out all those kind of like, because of the family history of diabetes, we will will do blood work it should be fasting the blood work okay so can you come back like tomorrow or Friday or next week to do those blood work we open at 8:00 so you don't you should stop if you want to do it tomorrow or at any day you should stop eating after 10 o'clock at night and in the morning you are allowed to only drink water, black coffee, or a black tea.

Okay, so. In the morning. Has to be in the morning? Oh, okay. Yeah. It has to be sometime in the morning then? Okay. I mean, how long can you stay without food? Yeah, that's a good point, it's. Do you work on the weekends? No, not on the weekends. So, if you don't work at the weekends, and you can either do it at the main hospital lab on the Meridian. On Eagle or the one downtown? Okay, but I will. Or any urgent care? I'll do it the weekend then. Okay, you want to do it the weekend?

Okay, totally. Do you take any daily multivitamins? No. No? Okay, good. All right. Because I'm also checking your thyroid hormone levels just to ensure nothing is causing unintentional weight gain. Okay. Have you tried to lose weight at all? No, I mean, I don't put, I don't put, I don't Effort into losing weight. Okay, no problem, don't feel bad about that. And then exercising, I mean, I do electrical work, so I'm always going up and down ladders, walking around. Well, that's a physical activity, see, that's the misunderstanding that people, it's good to stay active, you have to stay active, okay? Otherwise, your muscle will get weaker, bones, everything. But that does not consist or doesn't really include an exercise. So what I mean by exercise is that you need to do a type of workup or workout, sorry, that will put your heart and muscles under stress and then you will recover. So free weight lifting or machine lifting, light jog, running, swimming, and you do this like for an hour, for example, but you start with 10 minutes and then gradually do 15 and a half an hour. 45 minutes. So this is what the exercise, it's the consistency of it. You're doing more workout of your skeletal muscles and you put more strain on them and strain on your heart a little bit, okay?

So, all right. Okay, so this will be like we call it the Stoppanga questionnaire that would see what is the likelihood of you having a sleep apnea, okay? Let me. I wonder if the test for the sleep apnea, I just, because we have a 1-year-old as well. Yeah. And he just wakes up in the night still, you know, he's still trying to. Yeah, I know, yeah, I know it's hard, but to try to, I don't know. Whatever you could do just to, do you wake up? Like, do you have interrupted sleep at night? Yeah, our 1-year-old. I mean, I think, too, this one and the smaller one. Yeah. If this one doesn't wake up, the other one does, and then wakes him up. Yes, we could do the... Let's just do the screening and then we'll hold off on ordering until we have like a better situation. And if we will, if you start kind of like lose weight and change your diet and change everything, then we could probably see, okay, do you still snore? Maybe you'll say, no, no more snoring.

He's not choking anymore. And we could kind of like hold off. But so we let just, so we talked about the snoring is yes. And you feel tired. apnea? I mean, we do go to sleep kind of late and wake up early, well, I mean. We try to go to sleep early, but the kids, their time. The average sleep time is like 11 for us, because our 7-year-old is still scared, so I have to put him to sleep, then I wake up and I go to that room and go to sleep there. Oh, okay, yeah, that's hard. So you scored 5, which puts you at a high likelihood of having the sleep apnea, so. Ideally, we should do the test, but we'll take into concentration the situation, family situation right now, but we'll continue to monitor that, okay? So make sure you sleep on the position that you are less likely to snore, and most time people, when they sleep on their back, they'll snore the most, and you also need to kind of like pay attention. If you hear him snoring, just give him an elbow on his back, okay? So this is the thing that you think you have hernia, so this is the sternum. and see this is the end of it, call it the xiphoid process. And you look, it's a piece of bone and a cartilage, so it can get sprained and inflamed, okay? So the more belly weight you have and the size and the more pressure sometimes it will put on it. So you can apply ice if it's hurting, you can take some Aleve or ibuprofen, but just take it with food.

All right? And I did put all the lab orders, so whenever you feel ready, if you want to do them Saturday. just stop eating at 10 o'clock on Friday night, in the morning, just eat, sorry, drink water, black tea, black coffee, and you can do it at the hospital or in your urgent care. Once I see the results, if it's easier for you just to come back and just review the results face-to-face to go over the results, would that be good? If there's something abnormal. If everything is normal and we don't need to have another meeting, that's good, okay? But if there's something abnormal, if you want to have like another like time Does like 5 o'clock usually work for you? Yeah, I mean. Yeah, Wednesdays are my longest days, so I can have, I can have you come in at 5 o'clock on Wednesdays. Yeah, that works for me. That work? Okay. And you know, maybe not today, but for the future, and, but if we're talking about weight loss, like right now, your weight, without any judgment, 227 pounds. And again, if we really would like to prevent you from having diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, et cetera, in the future, is to really get you down to like 190. So that's like 30, 40 pounds, all right? And we know like diet and exercise, yeah, can help much, but not that significant. If you want to talk a little bit more, if you're interested in the future visits about like weight loss medications, I'm happy to give you some counseling. We know the insurance, most insurance, they don't cover those kind of like brand medications like Mounjaro or Ozempic or Wegovy that you hear people talking about them. They're very effective in weight loss. There is compound version of these medications. It's still not cheap, maybe costing like between $200 to $300 a month. for like 4 injections, because it's a weekly injection, okay?

So, if you'll not have more discussion about them, we can talk more about them in the future, okay? Okay. Sounds good? Yeah. So, your homework to do the blood work, Saturday, and -by a blood pressure monitor, and I need to see 7 days of a blood pressure monitoring at home. Okay. I need to see those numbers, okay? Okay. All right? And when I see the results, I'll call you, or simply if you want to schedule a follow-up with me next week.

So next Wednesday All right, so just confirm next week Wednesday with the front, okay? Okay. All right, guys, it was very nice meeting you, okay? Very nice meeting you, thank you. Take care. Yeah, all right. Bye. -2 people up front? No. Oh, okay. All right, so how they will call like and get like to schedule a follow-up appointment? They need to call like tomorrow? Yep, you guys can just call tomorrow. Yeah, just.

Or if you have MyChart, you can also just schedule on MyChart too. Yeah. For the blood work? No, no, for the Wednesday appointment. Oh, okay. I can, I'll just call tomorrow. He didn't have MyChart. Okay, so just call tomorrow. I put a note so they can see my note and I want to see him back next Wednesday, okay? Okay. Sounds good. All right, no problem. Thank you. You guys take care. I appreciate it. Have a good night. Can we do this up there? Yeah, just leave it up there, just to give it to Lucas.",,,

How about 12 years ago? Okay. 13 years. 12, 13 years ago. It was great. In my late 40s. I was. Oh, you were a little young then. I was. Yeah. Okay. Do you want the chlamydia gonorrhea testing with it? I don't think I need it. Okay. Great. And then why is this giving me a flag?

Oh, no. Okay. All right. Then we're doing that today. If you're interested in the COVID booster, we have those. And then, okay. Now, your last colonoscopy was in 2014. So they said 10 years. So this fall, 10 years ago is by the blink of an eye. So I can refer you now if you want, and then have that done. Yeah. Because it takes a while. They'll call you. Well, they might call you now, but just remind them, well, in my 10 years is this fall. And then they'll say, oh, we'll put you on the list to call you this fall. Okay. They're super good about that. So we want to thank you.

Okay. And then your diabetes screen, we've been doing that regularly with your wellness labs. Your last tetanus was It was in 2017. If you were to get injured today, they'd probably give you an updated tetanus. About seven years, they'll update that. Your shingles vaccines are done, flu vaccine. Everything's done, so good. Oh, your pneumonia vaccine, oh, not to 65. At 65, we'll recommend a pneumonia vaccine.

Let's go over your labs. So we are due for just your regular wellness labs today. So like your cholesterol, your metabolic count, looks at your kidney, liver function, blood counts, thyroid, all that. Are you okay with that? I am, fine. All right, is there anything special that you are concerned about that you would like me to check? No, I ate, though, and drank a lot of coffee this morning, just down there. No, good for you. I know. I hope it tasted good. It was. It was. Great. Okay, let's see. Yeah, since I know that, your blood sugar might be a little bit higher than what I would expect, so just as long as we know it's non-fasting, we're fine.

So yeah. Okay, everything looks good. All right. And depression screen is negative. You're feeling well in that regard, doing okay? Yeah, my mom fell, broke her leg. Seven, we're seven weeks out now. It's been a nightmare. Does she live here? No, but I'm trying to get her down here. She lives in Mountain Home, so it's back and forth. Stay in, but through it all, I'm surviving, and we're working through it.

It's just a process. Okay. And no anxiety? No. You do like to drink alcohol, but? I did have it pretty much under control, and then my mother fell and broke her leg, so yeah. But no, I have that. I got that. Okay, great. You know the risks. I do, I do. Great. Let's see, we did all of that, we did all of that. Okay, I think I've asked all my questions.

Are you exercising pretty regularly? That's awesome. Okay, good. Are you feeling any shortness of breath today? Nope. And how about any chest pain or heart palpitations? Nope. My mother does have AFib. Oh, and? When was she diagnosed? Maybe 10 years ago? Okay, late in life, so I'm sure that's coming for me too. Okay. Well, we'll definitely keep our eyes open for you. So you may or may not experience symptoms.

A lot of people that have it, they can get lightheaded or dizzy, and a lot of times they can feel it, and it feels like palpitations. And so if that happens, then you need to get ahold of me and let us do an EKG to see if that looks like that's happening. And then also, if the EKG doesn't indicate it, then we would do what's called a Holter monitor, which looks at the rhythm over two weeks' time to see if you're going in and out of it. Because some people, a lot of people don't stay in it all the time. They just go in and out of it, but that's almost worse. So, all right, let's take a listen. Okay, sorry, this is cold. Big breath. And out. Good. Again. Good, your lungs sound really good. They're nice and clear. Good. You have a sore right here on the right side of your back.

I know, I picked it. I picked it. What's that? I picked it. Oh, okay. All right, that's fine. And the skin doctor said it's fine, but. Okay, good. I picked it a couple days ago. Good. Because I couldn't reach it. That sounds like something I would do, but I picked it too. Sorry. No, I'm sorry. Okay, let's listen to your heart. It sounds good, nice and normal. It does not sound to be an a-fib and there's no murmur. Good. And listen to your carotid arteries. Hold your breath. Breathe. Hold your breath. Breathe. Look straight ahead. Do you have any difficulty swallowing? No. Okay. And do you have any pain? No. Okay. Good. I don't feel any small lymph nodes. Your thyroid feels normal in size. So all those good things.

Let's take a look at your ears. Any problems with your hearing you're worried about? No. I'm a little worried about my husband's. Is he willing to get his hearing checked? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So he's not willing to get his hearing checked. Oh. There's nothing wrong with his hearing. Oh. And it's you. There's nothing. I'm humble. Okay. Good. Good. You need to stop that. It's me. It's my fault.

I'm going to have you stick your tongue out and open your mouth. Put it back into your throat. Sorry. You don't have to. Good. Looks good. Okay. Okay. I'm going to have you squeeze my fingers and lift my hands up. Good. Good. You have good normal strength, equal grip, all that stuff. That's really good. I'm going to have you lay back for me. Are you having any difficulty with swelling in your legs or feet? No. Good. You're not swelling at all today. So have you been out in the sun tanning? Like tell me.

I... Your skin looks so pretty. I garden. That's it? And I'm getting my mom's house ready to sell. Oh. Is your mom like in an assisted living place now? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. She's in her own home in a wheelchair. Not quite as scary as you today. Not really. I've trained her. Oh. And prepared that house. I've got people coming in. Oh good. At least once a day to check on her. Oh good. And then I'm going to get her moved down here where I can be the one so she can still be independent. She's not quite ready for assisted living. We toured several weeks ago and looked at them. Took her the information and number one she said, I can't afford that. I said, Mom, you could afford it. But after looking at things, she's not there yet. Yeah. So. So are you going to buy a home here for her? We're going to rent. Oh good. So sell her house. And I've got a two bedroom apartment in Kimberly. A friend has it. And it's small enough and there's no carpet so her wheelchair will get around. That's awesome. Yeah. So that's the first plan. I mean, you never know, right? Sure. It just is such a huge thing. Has she been in this home for a long time? Yeah, three years. So she'll struggle a little bit. Yeah. Listen to your belly. Are your bowels and bladder working okay? Yeah. No blood in your urinary stool? No. Any tenderness here? Nope. Over here? Nope. Take a deep breath in. Blow out. Any tenderness there? No tenderness. Is it more because I'm pushing on it? Yeah, I think so. Be careful. Don't push on the glass. Okay. We'll get like a... We'll have another problem. Oh my gosh. It wouldn't be the first time. I have been drinking coffee. We laugh together. We enjoy womanhood. No abdominal... No. Hernia is appreciated. No. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. By the doctor. No. The mild tenderness of the left upper ear. Okay. Let me put this here. I'm going to grab my nurse because I'm not being an octopus to do this without her. That's fine. You could be a crowbar. I'm pretty sure you'd get in there. A whole bunch of gel. Maybe you need a mask in case the dust comes flying out. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious. You're going to be fine. It's been a while since I've had this. Oh man. You know, I remember the days when I was embarrassed. You know, I was like, oh my gosh. And now it's like, just get it done. Just be done. I know, I know. Hang on just a second. Isabella, can you help me? Scooch. You're bummed down like five scooches. The last one I had, I went in for my wellness. It was like four in the afternoon. It was the end of the day. And I've been seeing patients all day. And Dr. Thompson was my doctor. And she was like, looks like your pap is due this fall. Let's just do it today. And I said, no, no. I have not showered for ten hours. No. Oh my gosh, it is me. We are doing it. I said, oh my gosh, don't you tell a single living soul what anything looks like down there. Or if you smell anything. I said, I will never let you live it down. Anyway, so yeah. Okay. First I'm going to look at the outside and make sure I don't see anything abnormal. And then I'll slide this back in with tons of goop on it. She said tons of goop. Got it. And then we'll be good. I'll find your shoulder so we don't break. Okay. And if you let your knees fall. I'm going to put it in place so it might not fall as far. But the farther you let them fall, the better. It's less uncomfortable. Do you have a couple little skin things down here? Yeah. I don't know if the dermatologist looks down here when they do their exam. No. But we'll just keep an eye on it. It looks like it's pretty normal, but there's one right here that I want to keep an eye on. On the left inner, it's like right in the groin actually. The lower groin. So yeah. Okay. Touch again. Everything else. I'm going to put my light on it to see if I see. You've got a few little spots on the left labia that are like pinpoint. They're not really skin tags. They're little brown spots. But we'll just keep a close eye. Okay. Touch again. Okay. Okay. Speculum is going in. Okay. A couple clicks here. There's no dust. Can you believe that? You have dusted well. You're a good housekeeper. Oh, there it is right there. Your uterus is tilted to the left. I don't need it anymore. It doesn't even matter. It's more just like, hey, out of curiosity, this is how your labia is. And this did make you spot a little bit. Okay. It's what's called friable, which means that outside of the cervix is easily irritated, which is very common in menopause. So you'll spot probably today. It might be like brownish like. Yeah. Okay. No problem. Well, then that's it. All right. And the inside of your vagina looks completely normal. Sorry, did you get a cramp in your leg? Yeah. Sorry. That's just when old people get those. I know. No, not old people. Everybody get those. You're not old. You cannot say you're old. You're closer and closer to your age. Oh, my God. I'm so old. Sixty is a new forty, right? I know. How old are you? Are you in your fifties? I am. I'm fifty-three. Oh, you're young. You are a young thing. I just turned sixty-one. I just never thought I would be in my fifties. And I remember when I was in my mid-to-late forties, I'm like, you are in your mid-forties. Now I'm like, you are in your mid-fifties. What the heck? Yeah. Time just flies. I know. And as long as you're feeling good. Yeah. Okay, so as far as follow-up goes, we'll get those labs today. The pap smear takes about a week to come back, so we give or take, and otherwise, yeah, let me know if you have any problems, questions, concerns. Okay. I'm here for you. And I'll just run over, do the blood, do you guys do it in this office? We do it right here, 10 steps away. So you'll go out this door, you'll turn left, and you'll just walk right into the lab. Perfect. Thank you for letting me...",,,

J96.91 Hypoxic respiratory failure
I89.0 Lymphedema of both lower extremities",".

Hi, how are you guys? Good. Oh, you're all ready for Halloween, aren't you? Oh, it's got a Halloween tie as well. Well, that's more than a lot of people. All right. When is it, tomorrow? Yep. Yeah. The 31st. Oh. You better be ready or they'll do the tricks instead of the treats. Yeah, we better go shopping.

All right, so you were just in the hospital. Yes. You came in to get a scope and then they found your oxygen was too low, so then they did some work up in the hospital and you've been home for about a week, is that right? Pretty close, I guess it was, you come home Friday, yeah. Okay, been doing okay since you got home? You're not on your oxygen, so. Well, she takes it at night. At night. They wandered at them. They're, they. I think they'd be happy if I was on it 24/7, but I'm not really set up to drag it around.

We got to get that tank back to them. Yeah, yeah. Do you have the finger monitor? Yes. Are you keeping your oxygen above 90? I try. Okay, well if it's not above 90 then you need the oxygen on. Yeah, or I start taking deep breaths. Yeah, so, what? Dr. Angelo is concerned, and Dr. Carter, he's the lung doctor. What we're concerned about is, so the right side of the heart pumps the blood into the lungs, and then it comes back to the left side, and the left side pumps it out to the body. And so when they did your echocardiogram, your ultrasound, your heart functions normal, so it pumps the blood out to the body just like it should. Mm-hmm. but for some reason you're still retaining water and you're getting swelling in your legs and and all that and so the see how big and strong this left side is. And this right side, look how little, tiny, weak it is, because it's job is just to pump into the lungs, and so it's only that far, but if something's going on with your lungs, It makes it harder for the blood to go through, and this right side is too weak to pump it forward, so some of that fluid backs up and you get a lot of swelling. And so we think that's the problem.

Okay. All of our other tests have looked okay, so it really hasn't shown it real well for us yet. She does take Lasix in the 40s and 80s, you know, trying to get the water off. Yeah. So that's what we're looking at. What I think we need to do is a procedure where we go inside the heart and measure those pressures. See what the pressure is up in there and see if that's causing our problem. That way we know for sure. and then when you meet with Dr. Hall next month, he can treat your lung problem a little bit better, maybe we get those pressures to go down so we don't have all that swelling, okay?

Now, what does that entail? It's not surgery or anything like that? No, but it's like a big IV. We usually put it in the wrist or in the arm, or sometimes we have to use the neck. We put a tube in, it'll go all the way up inside the heart and we'll measure, we'll go through every different chamber of the heart and measure all the pressures. And then if the pressures are high enough, we can give you some medicine while we're in there to see if that medicine lowers- Where's your pressure? And that'll give us information to give to Dr. Carter about the lungs to see if there's anything different to do about the lungs. Does that make, that, so it's not a, not a real. invasive procedure, we're not doing like, it's probably less than that colonoscopy and stuff that you're going to do, but. Anything's better than colonoscopy. Well, the prep is what's bad. Yeah, and we'll give you some pain medicine, some sleeping medicine, make sure you're comfortable while we're doing the procedure. How long does it take? You'll be here a few hours, the procedure itself takes about 30-45 minutes. They have to bring you in, you have to get in the gown, put an IV in, and we take you back there, do it, bring you back, and wherever we went in at, we have to kind of hold pressure and make sure it doesn't bleed before we send you home so we watch you for a couple of hours.

All right. Now, can you schedule that or? Yeah, we'll schedule it right now. Do you want to do it on Friday of this week or Wednesday next week? Would any of those days work for you? What about Wednesday of next week? I don't think we... I should have brought my phone. Let me see, I don't think you have any of that. I think we could schedule it for Wednesday of next week, and then if there's something going on. A week from today? Yeah, you have a pain medicine clinic visit on Friday, and then there's no other doctor appointments till the end of November, so if you want to do it next Wednesday, and then if something's going on, you call us and reschedule? Yeah, a week from today. All right.

She don't have to do any diet or anything or? No, usually we skip breakfast that day depending on what time it is just so your belly's not full of food and we lay you flat and there's a camera to take pictures but. Sometimes when we give people the sedation, they get an upset stomach and they might throw up. And if you're laying flat on your back and you throw up, all of it goes into your lungs. Yeah. So we prefer if you skip breakfast that day. All right. So that'll help us to kind of know more about what's going on and figure out what we can do. Is your swelling kind of been under control with the water pills that you're on or is it? No, I wear, I've got these wraps. Yeah. And then at night, for an hour every night, I wear a boot, is that what they call it? Yeah. To me, it's a sleeve where you put it on and it goes. Does it squeeze your legs? Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right now, I do that every night. Well, so this will tell us if it's a heart problem. The other problem is called lymphedema. That's just where the... The legs just can't get the fluid back up to the body on its own like it should. Yeah. And that's what they're treating you for currently, but we're going to see if there's something else we can do to make that better, make that easier to treat, okay?

So what they're doing is at the end of the line. Well, that's why we're looking for other things, but they're doing everything they can to keep that water off, but it just might be that the lymphatic system is in charge of getting all the extra fluid in your legs. and getting it back up to your body, and if that lymphatic system doesn't work real well, then it's, there's not a good way to get it back to the body. Right. So, listen to your heart. Mm-hmm. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Sounds good, did you say? Your heart sounds great. It wouldn't matter. What's that? It wouldn't matter then. Well, I know that's why we had to do that test. The sounds are... don't tell us everything we need to know. All right. So, let me talk with the nurse, she'll get you scheduled for next Wednesday, she'll come and give you instructions, what time to be there, where to go, all that stuff. No. Do you do that here in the? Yeah, so you'll just check in at the front over there and they'll take you back to our procedure area. Okay, yeah, but. Now you said, you mentioned Dr. Romano and you mentioned Dr. Carter, so everybody's in the know? They will be. That's why they sent you to me. Exactly.

All right. I'm sure. Okay, still be in just a second. All right. Thank you. Mm-hmm. I like your tie. Yeah. That's cool. I have a whole suit that looks like this. It's a little too much to wear to work, though. Oh, come on, you should. You should work tomorrow. When else can you come along? I am. Look at the Saturday Night Live, dude, it's funny. Tom Hanks Saturday Night Live? No. It's too much. Like this. Oh, that? Oh. That's amazing. I kind of looked at him and he didn't acknowledge it. 5:30?",,,

Yeah. All right.

What else do you want to tell me? Excuse me. Do what? What else do you want to tell me? Do we cover the bases there? I've got a pain in my butt. Fortunately, I don't have to deal with that. All right.

Well, I think that's, you know, I don't know that we need to do a whole lot here. Seems to me like things are going okay. Your cholesterol actually is well managed. I'm happy about that. And you're on the right medicines for that. You're on the aspirin, that's both for your leg and your heart, and you're not having trouble as far as I can tell. You had an echo in August, which showed that your heart was doing basically okay then. And that's obviously good news. I think, wasn't that August 23, or does it say 24? It says 24, well, I put 24, maybe I was wrong, let's see, let's find out. Because I looked it up on his MyChart. Nope, 24. Oh, okay. I wonder where I was. You were at Al's, it looks like, or you got the Echo at Al's. Okay. It's okay. But it just appeared different in here for that, but it's dated the 20, this year. Oh, we could look back, but I don't think it matters. Yeah. You were admitted, now I'm looking, no, you weren't admitted, that was for the echo. Probably doesn't matter. You don't have anything to add? Do you have anything to add? Well, don't move, just stay right there, I'll listen to you. Big deep breath, and then breathe normally. Do we, do you go to the Coumadin clinic? The what? The Warfarin clinic? Am I wrong? He gets it checked every few days just as a labber. Oh, you get it done as a lab? I don't know where. Where do you live? Council. Council, okay. And the aspirin, now we can talk about the aspirin, there are There's some debates about this. Let me put it simply. Let's say you didn't have the trouble with your legs. It's probably the case that we talk about whether or not Adding the aspirin to the warfarin was absolutely necessary. They were moving to a place now where when someone has what we call stable coronary artery disease, and what we mean by stable is no trouble, no new stents or whatever for the last year. That if they also need warfarin or the other ones, Eliquis, those kind of things, we would think of it as acceptable to be off the aspirin in order to reduce the risk of bleeding. I think in your case that for the moment at least I would leave you on it because of your legs because it's also a similar kind of an issue as the heart in terms of taking the aspirin you might talk to the vascular surgeon after you're done with the the surgery, they're often pretty loose about this. They'll say something like, well, take it for two months and then stop it or something like that. And now, then it would be a judgment call. It doesn't mean that we would stop the aspirin for your heart. It's just that we would have the opportunity to think about it and say, do I think the risk of bleeding It's enough that this guy compared to someone else, you know, if you've had a problem with bleeding before, you have bloody noses, you have other kinds of reasons to think about not taking the aspirin, then it would be very reasonable to not take it. But on the other hand, if you've tolerated it, and you haven't had any trouble the bias my bias would be to continue it so a lot of talking there to the final conclusion that I'm going to say let's just have you continue to take the aspirin unless there were a problem just to let you know though that if there was some issue you started to have a nosebleed or some other trouble with the aspirin, it probably would be the case that we would be okay with stopping the aspirin, as long as you were still on the Coumadin, of course. And then I outlined all that just because I don't have anything else to talk about. You know, your cholesterol is the main thing to do in terms of reducing your risk and you're on the right medicine and your numbers are low, your blood pressure is well controlled. You could work on your activity after you're done with the surgery, maybe you could, I don't know, ask the surgeon whether you could get enrolled in the rehab program. Those would be good things for you, but from a heart perspective, I think you're doing well, and I'd see you back in a year.

Okay, I have a question. Mm-hmm. Okay, you know, like, we just kind of inadvertently discovered. this aneurysm and then this one, that made me concerned, you know, for, I've heard of aneurysms in the heart or whatever, and so Do you think there's an increased risk for that now, and how would we know that? I would say no, and the simple answer is that we don't go test, well, first let's focus on the heart. and the blood supply to the heart. We don't find it's valuable to just randomly test people who are not having symptoms of concern for blockages. in their heart. So we do feel like it's the right thing to do, to do two things. One is wait until someone has some sort of symptom that would call our attention to it. But second is to stay active in order to provoke symptoms if one were to have a problem. Now you're not as active as you could be right now as you were to, it's one of the reasons I mentioned the rehab. It would, the best way to test the question of whether your heart's doing all right is to stay at least moderately active, because then you would know, then you would, you'd say, well, you know, I can walk the dog, I can go two blocks, I can pick up the pace a little bit as I'm heading home, and I get a little bit. breathing harder, that's the way I feel, that's good, I feel good that way. And then you do that, and then 6 months later you start to notice, I can't get around the block. Nah, that's the time to call attention to it and we would look into it. In terms of other kinds of vascular problems, most of the big vessel things we don't necessarily screen for, although I'm going to assume that the vascular surgeon has screened for other big vessel aneurysm-like problems, particularly aneurysm in the belly, and you have had screening for that in the past, so we wouldn't have any need to do those kinds of tests, I don't think. Okay. Because that was kind of my concern after this. I didn't know. Yeah. With the other attack and stuff. It's a good thought, but I think we're doing what we should do. Okay. If you start to get back into being active after your surgery and things don't seem right, you let me know and then we'll. We'll talk about it. Okay. All right. Did you get all that? Yeah, I think so. Okay, I'm good then.

ulld so, you know, when COVID came, we did get out of coming like once a year. Yep. Is it a good idea for him to check in once a year or just as needed? You know, that's another good question. You know, it's a little bit of a style kind of a thing, and it's a, in our local kind of culture, it's more common for people to follow up with a cardiologist once a year. But I'll tell you, in other regions it isn't, you know, and it's not, you can tell with him, it hasn't, it wouldn't have added much to what was going on because everything looks like it's going pretty well. And yes, if you have a good relationship with a primary care doc and things are stable. It doesn't add that much, to be honest with you. The one thing it does do is it makes it a little harder to get back in after three years goes by. You have to wait for, you know, but if there's an emergency or something, then we can change that, of course. But the one... You know, of all the different things, you don't probably have anything other than that if you did come in once a year, then it would be easier to get a follow-up appointment. So maybe what we'll do is unless... Some other indication, we'll try for every 2 years. Alright, I like it. And it's obvious that we have somebody in the family paying attention. So, we'll probably do all right with that. All right. It will be a long drive. All right, you guys take care. Thank you so much. I think you're doing fine. It's good to see you. And you can just wander on out.",,,

Z71.85 Immunization counseling","He is here with his mother and father who provide the history, pronouns, or he and his. Hey guys, how's it going? Good, good, good. Liam's gotten so big, my goodness.

He's been chunking himself up. Wow. All right, well, I cannot remember, was I using this already last time you guys were in? Yeah. Okay, perfect. Any questions or concerns you guys have to take today? I'm going to hold this. Yeah, let's see. I was over here saying no, not at all. Okay.

So he makes these high-pitched snoring sounds. Mm-hmm. Is that normal for babies to make like these? Yeah, probably. It's like wheezing. It seems like it's dry. Okay. And... I thought it was more like a... So I did video some of them, like I got two sets of them. Yeah. So one I feel like is positional, like when he's like kind of scrunched down, then he makes that noise, like the humming kind of sound, but lately I feel like it seems like it's just dry and like. like a rattly sound, but he doesn't have congestion or anything like that. Okay, yeah. So is there something we need to be watching out for?

Yeah, well, what context is that happening in? Like, what is he usually doing when you're noticing it? Sleeping. Sleeping? And that's why I was like, maybe it's snoring. Well, no, it's just dry in the front. It's dry. Yeah. Do you notice that too? I, like I said, I thought it was a hum, not. Oh, well, this is different from the hum. I hold him for his naps most of the time. Okay, so the hum seemed positional to you and then you haven't really noticed that once you've kind of straightened things out. You've straightened him out, yeah. Okay, are you noticing any like work of breathing when he's doing that? Are you noticing he's really pulling or skin-sucking between ribs or on collarbones? Okay.

So, yeah, so hard to say exactly what that is. If it just sounds kind of dry and rattly, there's kind of two thoughts there. One, he could be dry because- Everyone's a little dry right now, just with the weather. Okay. Some of it could also be, so all kids have some degree of reflux, right? And so we can get a little of that kind of gurgly sound, especially when kids are laying backwards. Okay. And, when we are breathing, all of our breathing gets shallower, or when we're sleeping, sorry, all of our breathing gets shallower. Okay. And so, if you've ever noticed, like, gosh, a lot of mornings when I get up, I have to, like, clear my throat or blow my nose, that's. That is what that is, so it could just be that we're kind of noticing that too. Okay, so then I was going to ask, should I be suctioning, because sometimes I will notice that he's got like, it's not snot, but it's like. Mm-hmm. I don't know what it is because it's not snot. Schmutz. Yeah, it's like some boogers. Yeah, if he's awake and it's bothering him, go ahead, but if he's sleeping and he's comfortable, you don't have to worry about it. Yeah, so all I would look for in general with breathing stuff, the main thing that we're looking for is that babies make a lot of noises with breathing often, the main thing you're looking for is that work, so if he's like really pulling with his tummy, you're seeing kind of those extra, you know, collarbones or ribs popping out while he's breathing, nasal flaring, head bobbing, those would all be reasons to let us know.

ulld then typically a baby is not going to be sleeping with that. Typically they're awake and like shoot something's wrong. So they'll let you know. But yeah. No, he is a-okay then. Good. It's just me being extra paranoid. And that might be all of these questions. So then he has, he, I've noticed on multiple occasions like his hands will like shake just for a minute or like his legs will shake, is that normal?

Yeah, and then can you kind of suppress it if it does happen? Yes, you can, yep, totally normal. Okay. And then, so he's 11 pounds and then he was for a minute there for like a couple days here and then he would go until like 5:00 a.m. without eating and now he's gone back and he's like, I want to eat at 2:00 and 3:00. Yeah. Should we be discouraging him? Not at this point.

So we say starting at four months, then we can feel confident that all babies are able to kind of keep their blood sugar up overnight. That being said, if you want to kind of keep feeding him on demand overnight, it's okay at four months. Yeah. But right now, I'd say just kind of trust his cues. Okay. And kind of go with it. And it could be, he looks like his growth has kind of taken off a little bit right now, so he just might be. [inaudible] right now. Yeah. Can you explain how much he's eating? He likes to eat like 5 ounce bottles. He did a 6. 2 days ago, didn't he? I think there was like a little break between the meetings, but yeah, like in an hour span, he had 6 ounces of standing tape. Putting it down. Yeah. So that was that quick. Oh, and so like when he wakes up at like 2 or 3 a.m., like there's a lot of whining, but like his eyes look like he's asleep whining. Uh-huh. And so it's like if I pick him up out of bed and I hold him and we rock, he like... rocks himself back to sleep.

Yeah. So then do I wake him back up to feed him? Not necessarily, if he's not acting, like, he should be waking up and telling you if he's hungry, if he is waking up because he's hungry, so he may just be, like, we all... wake up a few times a night when a REM cycle completes and then for most of the time we just kind of roll over and go back to sleep and don't remember that we did that. Okay. So it could be that he's just getting fussy at the end of one of his REM cycles. So if he's not waking up all the way and asking to eat and you're just kind of rocking him and putting back down that's fine. Okay, because we tried to let him, that one time that we tried to just let him whine, like he'll whine for 30 minutes. Uh-huh. But eyes are closed. Yeah. It sounds like the whine, like he's trying to get out of the swallow. You know, like he can't get his arms out, like type of thing. Gotcha. Yeah. And it's just enough to wake you up and be like, what's this kid doing, you know? Yeah, yeah. So I would say he's still at the age you can definitely, like it's not going to do anything. any harm or like hurt you in the long run for sleep training if you want to like pick him up and comfort him a little bit because she doesn't need anything. But if he's not fully waking up and he's like kind of soothing him and then laying him down is enough, you don't necessarily have to wake him up to feed him then.

Okay. So he should be fine to kind of sleep through. Okay. Yeah. And then, okay, so this is probably a weird question, but like sometimes when he sits up against me, so like I'll bring my legs up and he'll sit and this one leg will go across the way it's supposed to and he'll put the other leg in. Okay. And- Should I be correcting that? Like, hey, look that back out. Like, wouldn't we carry him? Wouldn't we carry him? So, like, he wants, like, his hips, like, this against you? Like, if I'm him, like, he wants to be like this? Yes, this one, this one, like, will go this way. Okay. Instead of, like, straddling him? Yes, instead of making that... you kind of shape and even in the carrier when we carry him he likes to kind of tuck one leg in he doesn't always want to have both legs out. Okay. That's something we fix or? That's okay as long as I mean if he's like unsafe in the carrier or something that you can kind of correct him but if he just wants to be held and he kind of wants to turn to this that's probably that's fine.

Okay. And I'll double check his hips and make sure everything's feeling normal there today. Okay. Yeah. Okay and then my other questions were vaccine related. Yeah. So she shared that there were four vaccines to do today so we kind of wanted to push it to three months like at his three-month visit when we do them. just for like his immune system to kind of do its own thing. thing, and then I was wondering if there was a way, because she said there were four or five, so there's three pokes and one oral vaccine that we recommend now, okay? Does it all have to happen at the same time? So the, I mean, it is your decision, not mine. Our strong recommendation is that we do them all at once.

Okay. So the reason for that is because the things that we are vaccinating against if he were to contract those things the smaller he is the more likely he is to die or have permanent disability from those illnesses. Yeah. So like rotavirus for instance that's one that it causes pretty severe diarrhea for any of us. Mm-hmm. It would be a miserable week and then we'd be over it and for babies they can die from it. Okay. So basically the earlier we can give them the better. Yeah. The other reason that we recommend it is it's the same series at 2, 4, and 6 months and we need a certain amount of spacing between them so if we start pushing off it's going to push back for kind of the rest of infancy and toddlerhood. Yes. For kind of getting things off schedule. Yeah. So as far as kind of immunity goes, so we've been giving two-month immunizations for decades now and have Good data that that is safe for kids immune systems and good for kids immune systems. A lot of parents worry about what are we doing kind of too much at once. And the kind of my response to that is if you think about all of these are like pieces of germs that we are exposing the immune system to so nothing that can actually cause infection just mouth against like a. countertop or your hand or something like that, that's going to expose him to that many more germs that are actually germs. Sure. So his immune system is very capable of handling it. And he's exposed to a whole lot more on a daily basis. It's just this is kind of targeted, kind of specific things that we're exposing his immune system to to teach him how to respond to these specific illnesses that can be really serious.

Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So what thoughts do you guys have? Yeah, I would still prefer to delay. Yeah, just delay just once, so then it's like 2, 4, and 6, and you can do 5 and 7. Well, our visits are at 2, 4, and 6, so you could come in for a nurse visit at 3 months. Okay. And do it then. Yeah. Okay. Maybe that might be better to do a 3x7. I don't know. I don't know. I just, I'm hesitant because it's a lot at once. Like... Do they typically get sick after they? No. So most commonly he would probably be sore in his thighs a little bit. He's old enough that it's okay for him to have a fever now, so we're like not worried about masking a fever if we give Tylenol, so you're free to give Tylenol for sore thighs.

That is typically all we see from this series. could theoretically, because their immune system is mounting a response, when our immune systems are mounting a response, we can sometimes have a fever and feel a little crummy, just like you would if you're sick, but that typically lasts like 24 hours at most, and vast majority of two-month-olds don't have that, it's just a little fussiness and soreness. Okay. And the thighs is the vast majority of what we see. Okay. Yep. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I guess we'll wait, okay, yeah, all right, any other questions? Questions that you guys have? No. Okay. Yeah. So we have, I'll grab it for you guys. So we have a vaccine declination form. Okay. And that is just to kind of go over that. I talked to you guys about the possible consequences of kind of turning down vaccines and the possible consequences of the illnesses that we vaccinate against and just going that we I'm saying that we ran through that also on that form it will say that we kind of made these guys available to you and we're happy to send you. copy so we don't have to look at them all here. I used to.

Oh, that's right. We did. That's right. Okay, perfect. So that would be basically saying that we provided you that information too. So we'll drop that later. Okay. Okay? Yeah. All right. Other questions that you guys had today? No, but did it change his old disease? Are we sure we want to? I see that in the middle. Okay. I just, we, like, he's not going to go to daycare, and he doesn't, he doesn't see other kids, he doesn't do anything, really. Yeah, the one thing that is in the back of my mind particularly is we have had a couple positive whooping cough tests in this clinic recently, so it is in the, it's present in the Emerald Gorge for sure. Yeah. And that can definitely be deadly for babies. Yeah.

The other stuff I don't know that it's, I haven't heard of it circulating. But yeah. Okay. But the recommendation is that they're all important and that we get them on time. But we're not saying we're not going to get them. Yeah. We're just wanting to push it out one month. Okay, I guess we'll wait until these ones complete. It's your decision, not mine, so if you guys are confident on that. I would rather we wait. Okay. Okay. Any, any reason that you guys wanted to wait like that month? Was there any reason for that period of time or? I don't know that we'd ever talked about three months. Okay. That was [inaudible] per se, but. Well, we didn't talk about tying, just delaying in general. That's just as far as the conversation had gone, so. So if you want to delay, how long do you want to delay for?

I mean, three months is a start, right? I just, we hadn't gotten that detailed in the conversation. No particular reason other than just preferring, within reason, natural development. Okay. Okay. Well, if you want to wait, then we'll wait. So, okay. So, we'll plan on, I guess, tentatively, then we'll have you guys schedule a visit just with the nurses in three months to do those shots. Okay. Okay? Yeah. Okay. And any other questions that you guys have other than just kind of general wellness? Okay. All right. How is Liam doing with his gassiness? We had talked about that a little bit last time. Good. It's like his digestive system figured itself out. It's fine now.

Awesome. Good, good. Great. And then feeding looks like it's going pretty well? Mm-hmm. Awesome. We do a mixture of eye pump, eye breastfeed. We give one formula feed every now and then. Love it. Awesome. So it sounds like we're in great shape there. And then this just didn't fill in today for some reason. Are you guys doing vitamin D supplement? Yes. Okay, perfect. Awesome. I'll put that in. I don't know why it didn't fill in. And then we'll stop asking you about it. Okay.

That's okay. Peeing and pooping okay lately? Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. Is it normal for his poop to be like mucousy and like strep? It can. Yellowy looking? Yeah, yeah, so sometimes- Times for a kid that we're seeing like that with fussiness and like just generally kind of like not kind of acting their normal self, that can sometimes fit with like a milk protein intolerance. Okay. But typically we would also see blood in the stool with that. And some degree of mucus is normal for everybody. So we do have glands that help to. Lubricate things. Lubricate things. Yeah, yeah. And so it may be that tape makes a little bit extra of that if we're not seeing any other signs of it. No, there's no other signs. It's just every once, it used to be more frequent and then now it's tapered off to where it's not that anymore, but then every once in a while.

maybe like once every couple days now you'll see like a jello-y kind of. Gotcha. And his poops have lessened. Uh-huh. Like he doesn't poop as frequently, maybe only three times a day versus it used to be like six times a day. Yeah, yeah, so totally normal and pretty common for that to happen, so oftentimes those poops will kind of decrease in frequency over time. And that's actually because breast milk and formula is such good nutrition that babies just kind of absorb all of it. So there's not like a whole lot of extra waste to poop out. So as long as poops are soft and easy to pass, we're not noticing any blood, he's otherwise comfortable. That is totally fine. Okay. Okay. Awesome. All right, and then sleep, it looks like that's going decently well, other than waking up a little more lately. Yeah, and then waking up. Okay. So it's like, I wake up at... 3 a.m. and he, or he'll wake up at 2, like stall until 3, and then he has to eat, and so he eats and then he'll wake up around 5:45 to like 6:30, which is the next time he wants to eat. Yeah. Okay. So, sounds- Pretty typical for two-month-olds, yeah. Okay. You can definitely continue to follow his lead, so if he wants to start sleeping more through the night again, that's totally fine. Okay. But yeah, I can show you his growth chart in just a second here. It looks like he's... he's definitely like okay take it off a little bit. Because I've been working so long. Yeah. You're doing great. You guys are doing awesome. So perfect. And then as far as two month milestones go it looks like he is doing everything we asked about. Oh yes. Did you guys Have any concerns with how he's learning things over time or developing? No. Okay. He's in love with the fan, that's his best friend. No. He don't even count when the fan is, if it's going, forget about you. Gotcha. So. All right, awesome, but it looks like he is doing that social smile, making eye contact, that kind of stuff too, right? So awesome, all right, great, and then any questions about car seat safety, general safety around the house kind of stuff, anything like that? Okay, awesome. All right, so numbers wise here, so this is what I was talking about. So he like really jumped up in his weight. He looks awesome. So he has gone, he was like hanging out around like 4th percentile last time we saw him, he's up to 29th percentile for his weight, so he is going great, yeah, and then height. We are right on track here. So he's very consistent kind of along this green line. So that was looking perfect. Okay. And then weight and length together. So his proportions where he was on the thinner side now, he is like right in the middle. That was nice and chunky. So yeah, so he's looking awesome. And then head circumference is looking fantastic as well. heart rate, oxygen level, breathing, and temperature are looking good. And then I just did kind of a manual check. So no news is always good news with those blood spark cards that we did, but this is looking completely normal. So I looked physically at the results and they're looking. great. Okay. Okay? I'd forgotten that we did one of them. Yeah, exactly. I'd say I've slept since then, but I haven't really, you know. But you haven't lost sleep because of that. That's right. Aw. Alright, I'll get all cleaned up. We'll take a closer look at him here. Okay. He has one eye that, like, see, it could be, and not the other one. Yeah. He got, like, a blocked tear duct. Probably, yeah, if you're not noticing any redness. In the eye itself. Yeah. And if you're not noticing that it's like looking like pus, the stuff that's backing up, that's totally fine. If it's ever, is it like kind of the like tears? Just the corner, is it redder than this one? Gotcha, good, but the eye isn't red. Yeah, yeah, so it's okay if we're like a little like kind of poofy here on the eye itself, but if the eye itself is not red. We're good. Okay. And then it should be kind of normal crusties. Bacterial pink eye is going to be, usually it's not subtle, so usually it looks like pus and you wipe it away and it's back as soon as you wipe it away. Yeah. And kids are uncomfortable. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. You be on your best behavior, okay? She's going to be real quick and then we'll dress you right back up. Alright. Okay, take. Let's take a listen, okay? Yeah. Whoa! Can you sing her a song? Can you sing her a song? Okay, heart and lungs and tummy sound beautiful. I've got a bright light for your eyes here. Woo! All right, none of us are going to take, sorry about that. Yeah, well, tell me about it, huh? All right, yeah, his eyes are definitely not looking affected, so I'm going to watch your dog. And then for that, you can, if there is kind of crustiness, you can always wipe that away with a warm cloth. And then sometimes doing just a little bit of kind of gentle massage can help. All right, kiddo, I got to look in those ears. What have you got going on in there, huh? Oh, nice, healthy ear there. Yeah. Let's look on this side. Oh, my goodness. There we go, nice hobby gear there. Okay, let's check on your tummy. When do they start showing signs of being ticklish? Oh man, I don't know if I know that. I don't think I've had that question before. Do you need to research that? I don't know if it's a study, but yeah, I don't know if that's something that kind of goes with development or it's a... child by child thing, so I'm sorry. I'll try and look into it again. Oh, yeah, he's going to write a dissertation, I'm thinking. Yeah, exactly. All right, good job, kiddo. And we're just going to check in your paper here. Alright, good job. Testicles and surface filled up nicely. Let's check on your hips next. Yeah, hips are completely normal, so I think that's probably just a little like, kind of how he likes to, how he's feeling comfortable with his hips, like, I don't see any signs that there's abnormal kind of anatomy or anything like that, so. Okay. Yeah. Well, he does have the worst posture in the world, so you know. That's okay, we don't ask too much of him, he's still working on that. Neck strength at this point, so that's okay. Yeah, you got very good neck strength though. Oh my goodness. Look at you. Are you doing a good job? You showing off. Yeah. Are you showing off? Look at you. That's outstanding. He's about to roll over. Oh my goodness. Is he doing that regularly? No. Okay. It's the first time. Whoa. He's done it three times in the last few days. Rolled over? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know I was supposed to announce it. Oh, you were. I thought it was from back to stomach that we wanted to pay attention to. Oh, no. So forward to back is actually usually the more common one. Yeah. That's a four-month milestone, so watch him go. Oh yeah, that's why I was like, oh yeah. So when he, we're probably, like if he's, he's not doing it reliably, reliably yet, you're probably going to say- It's still okay to kind of swaddle his arms, but once we're reliable, then you can still swaddle his bottom, but just have his arms be sleeping. Whoa, let's move you out of that, okay? Is it okay if I use this pocket? Yes. Okay, perfect. Yeah. He did it over here too. Oh my gosh. That's okay. No, no, no. Earlier. Okay. He did that. Let me try a crusty pile. Yeah. Alright. Well, he looks perfect, guys. So, yeah, so you guys are good to get him dressed, and then I'll quick grab that form so we can run through it, and I'll be back in, okay? What'd you think? I was thinking we could get his hand out and grab it. Oh, it's right back on the table, thank you. We can keep our Wednesdays off if we're over there too. Wow, that would be really fair. I was looking at either of us to grab these out of here. I don't know how to, but like the label, like the sticker doesn't have that label on it, you know. And then Daniel in three is. So I decided it would kind of like look if the boys have been, if they weren't very, if it seemed a little more like maybe the hot committee as well should be more willing to like look into this, but it sounds like it's pretty promising. I don't think there's no space down there, like where's the space? No, so that's the issue on, yeah, we would be in the blue side disciplinary space with him and Sophia, which are already there on Monday. Okay, and is that where, like, Olivia is? So Olivia's, like, one more spot around there. Okay. But- Somebody doesn't know, even if they're women, like half the time there's like too many people in that situation, we're just like crammed, everyone else like, we didn't, like, us and... Emily and Sophia, we share like three rooms and we're constantly walking into the long room. Okay, I got them all right, so we have Pediarix, Hep B, DTaP, and polio, and then we've got rotavirus pneumococcus, and- to the room that, like, I had set up, and so then I walked in, like, with the patient, and there's, like, a whole family in there, and I was like, go to patient's station up there, and then I'm like, where did my vitals go? And then I opened the room. Now that's not a red box. And it selects the one that's highlighted. I'll have them sign now. We can do this later. Right there. And then it's the second one down. There's a little check box. Click that and then select your printer. You're going to have to change it. It's going to be... 008, is that what it is? I like it, here you go. And then, if you just want one? Yeah. Then you just have to look for one. Oh, nice. I don't know why you have to go to the patient station, like, guys, it's weird, but that's how it is. There you go. I'm not going to do it. They did. Okay, so did she take the- Part of the hour. But yeah, I thought it was time when I filled up the form, and I was like, oh, I actually, like, think about it, and I remember that I put it in, which for us others, like, when it's like, we're pretty good at it, and it's weird. [inaudible] Yep, I bought that. You'll get my snacks. I have snacks. Sorry about that. I cleaned that room. Oh, thank you. She was like, whoa. She was like, it's cool. And then I, like, pulled up, like, the moment she typed in the phone number, I was like, oh, yeah, I have, like, a telephone, like, to put in, like, the name of it, because I called up the name of it. And she thought I was talking about the baby. Oh, no, this is from here. I was like, oh. Tell me more. I was like, interesting. Ugh. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You're welcome. Take care, guys. All right. Okay. So the declamation, for a thing, usually, if there is-",,,

E07.9 Thyroid disorder","Well, how has your blood pressure been at home? It's been good. It's just right now that a girl's on vacation. I'm stressing with the air freight that I have to get in. I'm an import specialist, so I got a lot of people on my back right now. And then one girl quit. So they kind of like put everything on us, and they can't deny the girl her vacation, because she already had it pre-done. So it's kind of like taking a lot of the stuff, yeah. So I mean, that's why I'm like, right now I'm trying to like, I told her, you coming back to check me out on my work? I was doing my emails again. But yeah, that's what it is, just because of the stressing of the work right now.

I'm thinking I'm looking for something else, because I just can't be like this. I have too much pressure with the customer and our work as well, you know? My customer works with the car. They're manufacturers for GM. So when there's no parts, the line shuts down, and they come after, like, put pressure on me to get that from where it has to come overseas, so we're here. So it's a lot of stuff.

But I know you're busy, too. I can see. Yeah. I think these days, I thought I was going to have a good week this day, but I guess not, everything's just. Did you ever do your labs last time? Your blood work? I'm not sure if I did or not. I ordered it. Let me see what happened. I ordered it when I saw you in July, but I don't see it resulted back, because the last set of labs I had was the one in February of 2023. And you weren't fasting that morning, so you probably told me you were going to come back. Probably so. But I'm fasting now, because I haven't even ate anything today at all. OK, perfect. Perfect, so I can do some blood work today, then. I did go see Friday. They took blood work for the thyroid. They took all, I think it was like four things they were checking for for the thyroid. I went with Dr. Chen, but I. Yeah. And then February 29, I'll have the ultrasound for the thyroid. I don't know if the results come to you as well, or. It doesn't, so I'm going to skip the thyroid test, then I'm going to check your blood count, your kidney, your liver, your cholesterol, and that A1C for the borderline sugar.

Because I bet you they checked the TSH, 3T3, 3T4, and thyroid antibodies. There was one more they were going to check, but she said they didn't check it. It was for the Hodgkin's disease or something like that. But I told her, I don't know, I've never had it. And she was asking me, have you ever done it? And I said, I don't know. I said, I don't know exactly what that. I should have just told her to go ahead and do it, while I was already there doing all that blood work. So, but it was too late. So, we'll just see what they say. But they took a long time. I just got in, not too, just barely, with Dr. Chen. I can pull it back and let you know if I checked it. I did, I checked all of the thyroid antibodies and stuff back in 19 and in 21, for the Hashimoto's and Graves, and they were all negative. Okay. Yeah, she had asked me, but I didn't, I didn't get a response. But I'll let them know next time when I go for that ultrasound. Very good.

All right, prescription-wise, we're still at the same pharmacy? Mm-hmm. Okay. Same pharmacy? Mm-hmm. We got the Losartan 50 milligram for high blood pressure, the Atorvastatin 10 for the cholesterol, and the vitamin D every week. Mm-hmm. I'm sending these prescriptions, is it Hope Medical Center or Health Pharmacy? Hope Medical Center. Okay.

What else can I do for you today? That's about it. Do you need a note for work? No, because I'm working from home. That's why I'm on the phone. You know, I work from home Mondays and Fridays. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I go into the office. So, yeah, what you can do for me if I can just not work no more in my life. I'm being home, I'll be fine. But sadly, no. No, but everything else I've been, I think just the way that I've been gaining.",,,

Z00.121 Encounter for routine child health examination with abnormal findings","Okay, that might be the only thing that saves me today because I have not typed a word. Um, all right, let me pull you up. Okay, so specific concerns today? Um, we can go through meds and everything. Not really, just his allergies. I just, ever since he was hospitalized in 2021, I think it was last. I think it was 22. Um, I just always get really scared. Okay, with the asthma and everything? Yes.

Okay, and so currently what is the asthma treatment right now? Um, we're just using the inhaler, so we're using the Flowvent daily. Okay. We should have been actually using the Flowvent, the allergy pill, the cetrazine, and the nasal spray a couple months before allergy season started, but his other doctor that we no longer see wouldn't refocus, so. Okay, okay. Yeah. Um, okay, so. Not because he did anything, but because of other stuff, yeah. Red tape. Yep.

Okay, um, so yes, so I have the albuterol, Zyrtec, Flowvent, I have the 110 micrograms inhaler, and were you doing that twice a day, once a day? Twice a day. Okay, two puffs or one puff? We do it one time a day, two puffs once a day. Okay, and then the Flonase once a day. Yeah. Okay, and was that working, controlling things? Yeah, it seems to be helping. Um, he started taking it again. I did one of the like video chats with someone and he refilled it for him because I was like, hey guys, I think it's bad. Um, it seems to be working pretty good when he remembers. Okay.

Um, but I wasn't sure if with the cetrazine, based upon his weight and everything, if we do need to bump that a little bit or if he's still good. No, a 10 milligram is an adult dose. Okay. So, there's not much more you can do. You can, although, how long has he been on the cetrazine? Three years, four years. Okay. I mean, it's been a while. Yeah. He's been taking it. So, if you feel like there could be some improvement, um, it is sometimes a good idea to switch different antihistamines so that you're not tolerant, you've just built up a tolerance to it. So, um, he's big enough he could do kind of any of the adult, um, antihistamines, like Allegra is a good one. Um, Zizol is newer. It's a newer form of cetrazine. Um, so it's just a different kind of, it's big kind of thing. Okay. Um, so that's a possibility too. Allegra is pretty, pretty standard. Um, so you could, we could switch it up and just kind of see if that makes an even bigger improvement too. Yeah. That can happen sometimes. I'm okay with switching it up just a little bit, especially just he has been taking the same one for so long and your body just kind of gets used to it and then it's like, well, I don't need this. I don't know. Yeah. What's this for?

So, um, and my only other concern really was just kind of surrounding his allergies as well as before he was getting shots once a week, but once he got on the prednisone when he was in the hospital, um, they told us no more shots for a while. And so I don't know when to start that back up because it's been, okay. But he's still on the flovent. So yeah. How often are you using your albuterol? Which one is the albuterol? Just the regular. Just the regular. Like when you have two, two puffs a day. No, the other. So it's either like a, so you have your flovent, which should be like orange. And then the albuterol should be the one that you use. Like if you're coughing or wheezing or the one I always have, you have in your backpack for like, Oh, they're either like blue or red or usually don't use it throughout the day. I mean, if I start coughing a lot, then I'm like, all right. I think I need to take a puff, but I don't know. So in the past, like, four weeks, how many times would you say you've used it? Uh, I think twice. Twice needed, um, but he wasn't taking the pills until we got him, and at that point, it was quite a bit, and it was, and I did, um, we have a, what am I thinking, Sam? What is it, the machine? Nebulizer. We have one of those at home, so we did a nebulizer treatment one night, too, because I was just like, nope, we're not, we're not waiting. Who was doing the allergy shots? It was the allergy group in Coldwell. Okay. And he was, I don't know, he was almost done, and then it kind of sucked, because then everything, but I just get so nervous. I don't know if that honestly elevated everything, or if it still helps, or. Yeah, I mean, it definitely can help.

I think going back to them wouldn't be a bad idea, just to kind of see where things are, and then he was following with pulmonology, too, right? Yeah, we haven't been back to see them for quite a while, because he's been doing great, but the pediatrician who saw him when he was admitted to the hospital in Boise said, you know what, it's better to get in with that, because we only have the one, and he's the one who, like, refers things to Medicaid, so. Yes. It was perfect. He's established with him. Okay. So, I mean, the allergy group also does asthma, so if you're okay with that, them kind of managing all of it makes sense to me, because it all goes together. That's why they do it, because it's allergy, asthma, skin. So, I think if you're looking at doing the allergy shots again, I think going back to them and just getting an overall picture would be good, because they can do, like, the breathing testing, see where he's at on his asthma, step him down if we can, that kind of stuff. Yeah, we can do that. They never did anything like that with him before. He would just walk in, they'd give him a shot, and he's off. Right. So, yeah, so it would be, I mean, it would be, like, a referral for asthma, asthma management, allergy management, and then whatever else. Yeah, cool. I'm okay with that. So, okay. Because he'd really like to go camping and not have mom have a panic attack that he can't go because he might not breathe. Yeah, yeah.

Okay, and then, so then the ADHD as well. So, it looks like the last visit was in July for that. So, are we still doing Focalin? We would like to, but that was never, yeah. Okay. When was the last time you took it? Do you remember, Sam? Which one was the Focalin? The most recent one she prescribed you, when you and Miles went. He took that once for us. So, she gave him a month of, like, the five, I think, and then she bumped him up to 10, and he took those, but then we never went back. Okay. I see the last fill or the last prescription was September. So, would that have been the last? Henry, yeah, I guess. Okay. I don't know if that's right. I'm not normally that mom, but I've been so busy with work. Okay. Let's see if I can find when it was filled. Where is my button? There it is. Okay. I don't want him.

So, before we would let him take the summers off and kind of do something, I just think that maybe it's best, especially with the age he's getting, to keep him on it during the summer, too, just so it's safe. Okay. So, it looks like the last time it was filled was actually May. We had written three prescriptions, but it was only filled in May, so. Oh, there we go. So I assume beginning of June would have been the last dosing. How has it been without it? Like manageable, or what are grades like? I mean, so sometimes it's kind of hard to focus, but I can manage it. I'm starting to do better right now without it, and I'm getting a lot of work done as much as I can right now. Okay. Yes, with that being said, I think Robert's one of those kiddos, like mom. So no, no shame. He needs a carrot, and so his carrot last year was wrestling. And so he knows that grades have to stay up 2.0 in order to wrestle, and that was great, but now we're at the end of the year, and I'm very concerned because he has some failing grades. And it's the end of the year anyway, kiddo, but it's harder. And I see him overwhelmed, I will say, a little overwhelmed. Loses homework sometimes, forgets it, and I just want to make sure that whatever's going to be easier for you, Alex. Mommy's not the one who has to deal with it, you are. So whatever you feel is going to help you is what's important. And what grade are you in right now? I'm a freshman. So you're going into, yeah. So you only have a few years left to make your future. Yeah. Like, are you planning on college? Have you thought about it? Thinking about going to college. Okay. So, yeah, these next three years are kind of a big deal to get into a college. Then, you know, make sure you can get a good place in there and stuff. So, yeah, I think we can definitely try that again, if you feel like it was working while you took it. It's a good one. So did you have any symptoms, like side effects, while you were taking it? Stomach aches, appetite, headaches? No, not really. No, a little drowsy. Well, actually, yeah, a little drowsy. And she would have him take it at night. The Focalin? Yeah. Yeah. And so I was like, okay. So we gave it to him at night for a little bit, but I was like, that's, I don't, yeah. I mean, I think you know where my wheels are spinning. So I stopped doing that, and then we just got off it for a little bit. But his grades were great. He was doing really good during wrestling, but I see it just being really overwhelmed and then really down on himself.

ulld his anxiety level, and I'm not sure if maybe we should start something that he can have at home for when he is having anxiety attacks. This has been consistent since he was young. Yeah. And potentially, if you get stable on your medication with the ADHD, it all goes together. And so if you can get everything stable and you have everything focused and under control, then sometimes the anxiety like dissipates a little bit too. So if you're consistent with it.

I also think there's other, you know, like supplements too that you can, like vitamins and like making sure your diet is really good and avoiding some like caffeine and all those things can really affect. Because those all affect the ADHD brain and it increases anxiety and it increases all those things. So like artificial diets have been shown to now like affect it. Not getting enough omega-3s and magnesium. Those two have been proven to really help those symptoms of focus and anxiety and mood and everything. So like kind of work. Working on those things too to get a good habit and then and see how that works. Because your anxiety levels today's like it's scored as mild. So that's you know good something that can definitely be improved for sure.

I'm going to say is this his anxiety has been consistent since he was young. Yeah and he does get the anxiety attacks and he doesn't drink energy drinks. He doesn't drink soda. He's a wrestler. That's his, he's really concentrated on that. Are you active now without the wrestling? Like do you do stuff, physical activity like running, biking, whatever? Sometimes, yeah. Okay, because that's the number one. That's the best medicine for everything anxiety mood related. It's getting moving, purposeful movement, good balanced diet, eating throughout the day. Especially if you start back on the meds, you're going to need to make sure you're eating breakfast, eating lunch, eating dinner, good healthy snacks, getting a lot of protein. Because it does decrease your appetite. So we don't want that to affect other things too.

So I think I don't like starting two different things at the same time. Yeah, we don't have to start it today. I just want to make sure that you know and that's in there that this, I mean he has an ESA. He's always felt very lonely. He's had depression, anxiety. Have we done counseling recently? He has done counseling, it's just not, it's not something he... Not your jam? Yeah, and that's okay. Yeah. I do counseling. I fully believe everybody should do counseling. I'm one of those people. Very helpful. But he's just always dealt with it and I do have anxiety disorder as well. So I know and I don't want him to feel like that. There's a couple times this year, he's had to call me at school. Mom, can you come up for a little bit and sit with me? So, and that was, that's okay. I don't mind doing that. I just want to make sure no one wants those feelings. Yeah. So we'll definitely monitor it for sure. I just don't, I want to kind of, I don't want to like add in too much right at the start. I'm okay with that. Since I don't know you that, I don't know you. I've known you for like 10 minutes, so.

So yeah, but we can, we can get the focal in going so you can finish out the year and then kind of see how summer goes and then if you feel like your anxiety happens in the summer or more just at school. Um, it's not mainly at school. It's just kind of, I don't know how to explain it. It just kind of happens. Mm-hmm. That's about how, that's about how you can explain it. It just kind of happens. It's not really a specific place. Okay. Any specific triggers like being in a crowd or being late or? I think it's just mainly if there's a problem or if I just think a little too much about something. Uh, it's funky. Yeah. It's funky. I get you. That's fair. That is a fair explanation of that. I mean, I like time to think, but it's like if I think too much about something then I'm like, I start getting worried about things that aren't relevant. Okay.

Um, so yeah, so I think let's get the Folkland going. Um, talking about some things like that you can do in those moments of like, can if, you know, if you're thinking about it at home in your room, can you like write it down? So it's just out of your brain. Um, that one's really helpful if you don't have to write a story or anything, but just like whatever thoughts are coming out of your brain, just write it down. So it's out and not just spinning and spinning and spinning, um, going for a walk, doing something, you know, weightlifting or something to, to kind of stop that process. of that spinning and and see if that helps and then after maybe after like a month or six weeks we can see where things are with the Focalin and and go from there. Yeah. Sound okay? I definitely do think the Focalin will help your anxiety nominate because you won't feel so scattered. Right, yeah. It does kind of focus those things hopefully that's the goal anyways. It does good on it. It just makes them drowsy but the thing is if it's not I know if it's not consistent it's always gonna be like that. So yeah. Okay. I'll put in information about like the different supplements that have been studied to that are really helpful. And then like some other like there are some apps too that kind of help with that that focus and kind of getting things out of your brain so it's somewhere else like to make tasks for the day or things like that that might be helpful. And then also just limiting your screen time too. Screens have been shown to increase anxiety, increase impulsivity, increase anger, all those things. So while it does work really well for the ADHD brain they have they have neuroscientists that have created those apps to make that brain addicted to it. So it is good to kind of limit your time on the screens especially like those you know fast-paced video games and things like that because it does increase all of those things in your whole body. It makes your nervous system just like shoot up and and so you gotta calm it down. So getting off the screen, going for a walk, doing some workouts, things like that can really help.

But we'll get all that going and then I'll get that referral to the allergy group. I was looking at that stuff next. Well have you eaten today? Did you eat today? No. You haven't? No. You didn't eat breakfast? No. At school? I didn't have time to. Well then I think you should do it today. Yeah. Get it out of the way. It is easier if you if you've already been not eating it's easier to just get it over with. But your grandparents on both sides of your family are not the healthiest and your great-grandparents are not either so you might as well, right? I mean it looks like the last one a year ago was better than the one prior to it so that's good. And he had eaten like an hour or two before we did that first one and then she was like, let's try a fasting one.

So yeah that was the only one that was and it wasn't like his cholesterol itself was good it was just the triglycerides were just above normal and then good cholesterol was just below normal and well no his actually actually his good cholesterol was fairly low but it was better than previous and then his bad cholesterol was just above the concern so my assumption it'll probably be better now but and then growth-wise really good because that was a concern before too but height great 55th percentile you're 5 foot 7 if you continue on that path probably maybe 5 9 5 10 around there boys keep growing into their 20s so weight has lied to me weight has been coming down a little bit so good you know stable not going up like it was and then overall BMI has gone down quite well so 97th percentile so still some room for improvement there but with working out and stuff muscle weighs a lot more so BMI is hard to tell we just want to keep it stable so so yeah and then blood pressure what okay see see where it's at for your age a little bit elevated on the blood pressure so that's something we'll watch adding on the focal end to so we will definitely watch that especially with the asthma meds that can increase things and then the focal and can increase things too so good physical activity every day good diet avoiding all the like sugary you know snack processed foods lower on the salt not completely eliminating salt but just kind of monitoring how much salt you're eating and then screen time all that stuff all of it goes together it all makes for a healthy brain and body so so it's all okay it's all based on height and age and so his he's kind of in the 90th percentile of the systolic the diastolic the 60s great yeah so for him it probably probably be around like 110 over 60 to 70 so yeah obviously we always want them below 120 over 80 but it all it's all based on age and height and so if there's this big chart and then this calculates it for us so we don't have to look at the big chart that's where are where are you all right so let me listen to ya I might not have to send you to the ER like I know when I go to my doctors they're always like Emily your blood pressure like I'm always stressed I'm sorry when I come in here I get anxious they're like dude we're gonna check it again in 30 minutes and if it doesn't go down and then it does so don't be like mom yeah the story kid and then don't have to do it today but with his asthma he would be eligible for a pneumococcal vaccine too just because he did your higher risk so in the fall like with the flu shot wouldn't be a bad idea deep breaths Oh, that's right. She said this was an issue on the back of her neck. Good. Lean back for me. Just normal breaths. Good. Okay. Well, you sound really good. Yay! Alright, I'll leave you alone then. Open my eyes. Okay, good. Sleeping okay? Yeah. I know. Yeah. I'll look at all that ear wax in there. Yeah. Told you. Not too bad. Inside. It's just the outside. It just doesn't, every time we try to clean them, it makes them cough. Yep. You don't need to clean them. Just clean the outside with a wash rag. Oh, I see. It's not inside. It's not on the inside. And I don't recommend Q-tips anyway, so... Okay.

Let me get these just ordered so I don't forget them all. And then... There we go. Are you tired? Okay. Well, you look tired, and you keep yawning, but you're not tired. Did you stay up late with your dad? No. You know, it's weird, because at like midnight-thirty, I heard some ruffling around in your room. And I was downstairs, and I swear I heard somebody walking around up there, and maybe moving stuff around, but... Just drinking some water. Oh, we're gonna change. Your water machine is downstairs. I have water in my Stanley. I can't find my purple Stanley cup, and I'm a little pissed off. Uh-oh. I know, I'm like, uh-oh. I was like, the purple one, I waited forever to get that one. And... And you want the, um... You want this to all go to the Save-On on Blaine in Caldwell? Yes, please. Okay. Oh, do I need to talk to you, like, once it's time... When he needs, um... Oh my gosh, we just talked about it, the machine. Oh, the nebulizer? When he needs more things for it, do I just, okay. Yeah, you can just send a message, um... And, yeah. Hopefully we don't need it, but... Truly. Um... Okay, so I'm gonna switch it to Allegra. Okay. So, you can... Keep the Zyrtec around, but, um... Switching that to Allegra. And then, Flonase... Now, do you know, does the Allegra make them drowsy? Should I maybe get that one out of here? No, well, so... Typically not. Okay. Everyone has a different... So, like, Zyrtec knocks me out. Yeah. Um... Allegra doesn't. Okay. Other people, it's the opposite. So, it's very... Just try it on a weekend, maybe, and see. Okay, yeah. Does Zyrtec make you drowsy? Uh... Or the Cetrazine? Yeah, yeah, no. No. It did. Like, when he first starts taking it, it does. So, we do it, like, at night for the first week or two, and then we just switch it today if he needs it. But really, I don't... I don't care, as long as he's not drowsy at school. But you have all summer. Yeah, you have summer to try it out. It really, it's very a personal reaction, and it's kind of weird, so. OK. Allergy group. Sign those. I will send the focal in when I get back to my other phone. And then let's follow up in about four to six weeks. OK, do you want an in-office visit, or does it matter? Yeah, just because with the blood pressure and everything, then we can do that. OK, and then are we going to do the blood draw today, too? Yes. OK, cool. Great. Yay. No, it's not. It is. It's so great. You know, Sarah, when I was pregnullt with you, and they drew my blood for the first time, I cried like a baby. And nulla had to hold my hand, and she was like, seriously, you're going to go through something way scarier. I think I need to go to the bathroom. I don't think so. I think you're good. I think you're fine. I'll tackle you down that walk-in. Well, you can definitely outrun me. I'll give you that. You can almost outrun Dad. We're older, OK? And I have short legs. I'm a little thicker than a snicker, OK? All right, I will get those. I will have them print off your AVS and schedule you after they do your labs. And then we'll see you again, OK? Thank you. I'll send you a message or call you at the labs. OK? Thank you so much. All right, they'll get all the paperwork for you. Cool, thank you. Thanks, guys.",,,

Oh, he usually gets in people really quickly, so that's odd. When is it scheduled? I told him I'd have to call back because my daughter and son-in-law had changes in schedules, so. Oh, okay. I said, let me call back. At the time, I did call him originally. He said they were back on. It was going to be a month before I could see him. Oh, okay.

ulld then did you get labs done somewhere else? No? No. Well, no, I just had the urine here two weeks ago or whatever. Oh, okay. Because I had some labs in the computer from your last visit, but I was just making sure you didn't get them done somewhere else. Okay. Well, you can get those ones today. Yeah. And I still have a little bit of discomfort with the bladder. I'm not sure what's going on. Maybe I don't know what on the medicine or something. I don't know. I mean, let me see if you had a UTI, if it really came back as a UTI. Because I don't think it came back as a UTI. You didn't have a true UTI. Nothing bad. You could have bladder issues. It may benefit you to see the urologist, because sometimes you can have chronic irritation in the bladder, and it can cause UTI-like symptoms.

Okay. Any pelvic pain? It's just lower in the abdomen. That's what it feels like, like a bladder. Because you had the hysterectomy, right? They took your ovaries? They took my ovaries. Okay. Do you have a bulge? Just the normal, I guess. Well, do you have a bulge in your vagina? Do you feel like a fullness in your vagina? No. No? Okay. Do you want me to do a pelvic exam and look? I mean, not that I know of. Do you have accidents on yourself, like leakage? No. When I had a bad cold, I did. It's because I was coughing, but other than that, no, I don't. Okay. But if you do a lot of coughing, you would leak? Just a little dab, yeah. Okay. No, because sometimes people like vaginal dryness can cause irritation, pelvic organ prolapse, which prolapse of the bladder can happen after hysterectomy. That can cause UTI-like symptoms. But if you want, I can do a pelvic exam, or I can refer you to urology, and they can just look inside of your bladder and make sure nothing is abnormal.

I'm just wondering, because I'm wondering if it has to do with the blood sugar, too, because I'll have times when I'm just kind of just not feeling well after I eat. And then, like in the morning, sometimes when I wake up, I end up having nausea. Mm-hmm. First thing in the morning. And then there's been times, too, when I've been really lightheaded. It seems like it's not staying on anything, keto or something. Well, what are your sugars when you check them? That's just it. I haven't really checked them that much. I have taken them, like, during the day or something, and they'll be at, like, 99 or something like that. Mm-hmm. But then there'll be other times when I'm lightheaded or whatever, and it'll have dipped down to 50. So it's like... Mm-hmm. But you're... Let me see. You're not taking any medicines, though, for your... No. And are you eating small, frequent meals? That's just it. I don't take... Not hungry. Well, you really need to have the CGI to have the scope of your stomach. You know, if you have this nausea, upset stomach all the time, you know, that's what you need to do. The irritate, the feeling like you have UTI. The last two times you were checked, you didn't have any. Okay. Well, the last time you were checked, you didn't have UTI. In November, you did have a UTI, but I think, you know, if you keep feeling like that over and over, it will benefit you to see the urologist. And you need to have, you should have a pelvic exam, whether you want to do it today or when you see them, you know, but I think you should have the pelvic exam too.

You get what I'm saying? Yeah, I understand what you're saying. And then how's your asthma? It's been okay. I haven't had too much fun with it. Okay. It's surprising though. You know, usually this time the allergies are just crazy. And then you're doing the Gavapentin, the Amitriptyline, all of that? Yes. Okay. And you don't feel like that makes you too sick or feel... I'm beginning to wonder, you know, you're on a low dose of, well, you're on a good dose of Amitriptyline, but I'm just wondering if that causes, makes you feel anything. Or have you been on those for a long time? Yeah, I've been on it for a pretty good long time. Now the, I did notice I was having more stomach issues for Gavapentin.

Oh yeah, we did talk about that, but you said you want to keep it because it helps with the... Yeah. And I think it might not be because of that. I think you really just need to get the EGD and see. And then do you still have your gallbladder? Yes. Okay. But are you having pain? You have pain not just after eating, it's like different times. Yeah, it can be different times and it's just uncomfortable or something, or sometimes while I'm eating, it's like it goes right through me. So it's like that. And you're due for your colonoscopy this year? Yes. Yeah. It's probably October, close to October. So yeah, that was another reason I was trying to get the EGD set up. Yeah, he might be able to do them at the same, like now at the same time, but he might just have to do the EGD now and the colonoscopy later. But I do think you need the EGD.

You know the EGD. Yeah. And then were you able to do the mammogram through the rurals? Yes. Oh, you did it. Okay. Yeah. And that was good. And I did the, they did the bone scanning. Yeah. Cause you say you thought you think your ovaries were taken out. Yeah, everything. And you have weak bones, but you didn't have osteoporosis. So you just need to take vitamin D every day. Yeah. I take vitamin D3. A thousand, 800 to a thousand is a fine. Okay. Now, and I had a question though, is I never had to take, of course I drink the water here so a lot, so it's got probably the calcium in it, but if I need to go on calcium, what dosage? Yeah. I don't think you need to right now, but if you did, it would be like 500 to 600. Okay. And then most of your calcium should, you should try to just increase the calcium in your diet. The average person may need like 1200 of calcium a day, but you should try to get as much calcium through your, you know, through your diet as possible.

Yeah. Cause I mean, like I said, I'll take different vitamins and I've been trying to, you know, take them and stay up. But you know, I asked you to quit. Um, I asked, I'm going to take fish. Well, I added fish oil. which I've never taken before, and then I take my magnesium and B3 and C and the B-complex. So I'm trying to make sure that, you know, from not eating, I'm still, you know, getting it. Right, right. And then with your urination, does it feel burning or what do you feel? Sometimes it feels like there's a little bit of a burn and sometimes it's just a discomfort. Okay. Do you have dryness? Yeah. Do you want to use some ashtrays, some estrogen cream? Okay. And no rashes or white spots or anything? No. Okay. I'll do the referral to the urologist, but I'll just start you on the ashtrays cream so then by the time you get to them, you know, they can say yes, you know, yes or no or whatever.

Because I remember, and then they can just check your urine too. And then you had, last year you had the, it's probably, it's probably best if I just do the pelvic exam. Because last year you had the BV, you had the trichomonas too, so I don't know if that's clear. Because I don't think you had a test of cure. Because I can just do your pelvic exam real quick. Okay. I'll just try to get someone to watch because he's like everywhere. All right. Because he, you want to try to do it today? I guess if I need to, I guess. Yeah, let's just do it. Okay. That way I can just make sure that's clear too. Because if you have irritation, it could be because of that. But you're not noticing a discharge? No. Okay. I mean, I had it before, but I, but you know, it's. And any new activity? No. Okay. I had nothing since July of last year. Okay. Well, I'm going to let you get undressed from the bottom down.

ulld then this visit, you know, you still need to get your lab so you could get that. And then call Dr. Khan, get in. Okay. Because you know, this visit was to follow up on really the stomach. Yeah. And I think, you know, I had to take medicine. And just the work is getting harder. Yeah. So you really need to get your stomach looked at so he could see if anything there. And then if not, it's like, okay, well, do you have gastroparesis, which is like the slum of the gut?

You get what I'm saying? Yeah. All right. Thank you. There's going to be a pelvic. I'm sorry? Pelvic. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone can chaperone me for a pelvic with an orange swan? Here's our first peak. Do you want to sit over here with us for just a minute? He's been pretty unrelaxed every time he's been here. He has his moments. You can put your feet up. If it's too far, sir. Because you're going to scoop till you feel like your butt is kind of.

Oops. Oh. Yes, I'm on my pants, so. Yeah, I haven't. And I wait till she comes. Yeah, because I got that from my boyfriend last year. It's no longer around. I got rid of him right away. Yeah. But, uh. He was my first partner in eight years. So I'm just like, wow. Yeah. It's crazy. I'm going to just look on the outside first. Relax your legs. Relax a little more. Okay. And the knees are just ingrown here. And then you do have some dryness.

Okay. But I don't see anything, you know, abnormal. Yeah. I mean, I knew something was definitely wrong last year when I had gotten the odor and stuff. And I was like, okay, something's definitely not right. Mm-hmm. It's a wonderful thing. Yeah. I'm going to clean this. No pads, ma'am, just the. What is your date of birth, ma'am? 3-28-66. Just the boob. Oh. My daughter has gotten on and on. But the stakeholder, she was pre-diabetic. So I've been told. You can't get on it. It's not indicated for pre-diabetes. She, you can get.

Is that bound? It used, people used to get it covered. Some people's insurances are still covering it. Not because they just don't realize why they're on it. Or maybe they used to be on that form in a long time, so they just think they're diabetic. But. I know that after it was previously covered, I can't remember the name now. Yeah, because back then, when the medicines first came out, you could get it approved. But now, you can't get it approved but for diabetes. But you do have diabetes. Yeah, and that's what I was... Because I didn't want to lose weight. It's like nothing is working even though I don't even eat. But if you think... The thing is, if you think that you have low blood sugar issues... Well, it seems like it's bouncing. Yeah, you just have to monitor and make sure you eat frequent meals. But I can prescribe it, but I have to see if your insurance will cover it. Because some insurances only cover it for uncontrolled diabetes. Because technically, your diabetes is controlled. So the better medicine for you would be Zetland or Wigobi, which is the weight loss version of those medicines. You get what I'm saying?

But I just have to see if your insurance covers it. I'm going to put the specimen in. I saw my mom and I saw my grandmother both suffer from diabetes. I'd like to nip it in the bud now. Your diabetes is well controlled. So you're doing well with your diabetes. But, you know, we can work on the weight loss portion. But I just have to see. The biggest limiter is the insurance. And they didn't leave your service at all, right? I was told that everything was taken. Okay. I'm just making sure. And yeah, your vaginal tissue is a little friable. Because I put the specimen in and you bled some. Yeah. Like I said, he was the only one that I had had. He was around for a year. And it looked like you probably have a little yeast in your leg. Oh, I'm going to... Yeast in the vagina.

Some people have yeast in the vagina. It doesn't matter if it's not causing... I don't have a bag in there. It doesn't matter if it's not causing symptoms per se. But I think you'll come back positive for at least, you know, yeast. So I might treat that if you have the irritation. Because that could be yeast. And I'll give you some of the estrogen cream. You just never had a history of breast cancer? No. Okay. I mean, topical estrogen, it doesn't get absorbed a whole bunch. But like if you had a history, I wouldn't give it to you. Because any hormonal therapy, in theory, you know, and you don't have your uterus and stuff anymore, so you don't have to worry about that part. I'm going to insert with my fingers, okay? Any pain? Not pain. Just discomfort. Okay. Over the bladder?

Yeah. Okay. That's what's weird, is it? That's why it's that... Well, I'll check your urine again today, and make sure you wipe well, because I just, you know, before you urinate. And then I'll do the urology referral. Okay. Just so they can look inside your bladder. I've never had any issues with that. And the estrogen, you'll use it like, well, for the first week or so, you can use it every day. And then after that, just go to two to three times a week. And then you're going to break from it for one week of the month. Oh, okay. Every month. You get what I'm saying? Yeah, I'm not even thinking about getting on a... And then it comes with an insert. You don't have to use the insert. You can put it on your finger. and do just a finger application around and then a right urethra and a little bit in the vagina, but that's it.

ully other questions? I think that's it. I'm just worried about that maybe, I don't know, I'm just worried that something's wrong. Here's some gauze. But you, I think you should see the urologist so that they can check you and then see the stomach doctor. And are you having a lot of constipation? No, actually, I'll have the opposite. Of the diarrhea? Yeah. And do the stool test, the HPAL or, make sure they give you that. Tell them I put in a urine sample for today, but you have O labs from February that you need to get drawn. Okay. Alright, thank you. Alright. Oops, sorry. That's okay. Okay. It doesn't cover the waist circumference, it looked like it might cover, but let me see what your A1C is to see if it's, you know, reasonable. Because I don't want to cause, you know, harm. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? I see what you're saying. Alrighty.",,,
9e675ee0-ff17-4e15-b177-fbaa528f7bf3,2.0,year,female,WELL CHILD CHECK,Z00.129 Encounter for well child examination without abnormal findings,"Emma is here with her mother and father, who have read the history print on her, she heard hers. What has been doing that? Okay, let me see if I can get it, no. Hey, how are you? It's really good to see you. Happy birthday. She had a birthday. You had a birthday? Oh my goodness. Happy birthday. What did you do for your birthday?

Birthday. Did you have cake? Cake. Ice cream. Ice cream. Mm-hmm. Wow. This is Splash Pad. What? That sounds like such a good thing. What do you have here? What's that? What is that? Yeah. Does it spin? You have to blow on it, remember? You are doing great, my friend.

All right. There you go. You take your time over there getting the questionnaire all filled out, Mom, and then I will. I will start when you're ready.

Here you go. That's awesome. Look at that. That looks so cool. Do you want to blow on the front? Okay. You try. Blow, blow, blow. Whoa. That's pretty cool, right? That looks so good. I love it. There you go. There you go. Emma, I think Miss Grace is looking more and more like you every time I see her. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Mm-hmm. Here you go. Here you go. Whoa, what's going on? Thank you for watching! Oh, my goodness. Yeah, we picked Emma up from daycare. It's in, like, Eastville. Uh-huh. And, uh... I was like, oh, we'll just take like Harmony all the way, no problem. Well, Harmony is close to that bridge. Oh my gosh, that's right. And I was like, no. So he got detoured a couple times, so we're a little late. Yeah, that's all right, you guys made it. And it was meant to be because I had somebody late cancel on the spot right after her, so we got time.

Perfect. Yeah. What's that? An elephant. An elephant, yeah. What other animals do you see in this room? A fly. Yeah. A fly. What about over there like that? What's that? Hey. What's that? No, what's that? A monkey. Yeah. And then over there, what's that? What's this? You know what this is. What's that? Monkey. Yeah, you got it. What's an elephant say? I love it. What does a monkey say? Great job. Oh, the butterfly. What does a butterfly say? Oh, that's tricky. I don't actually have an answer for that one. It's wise, you know. Yeah.

Okay, hold on. All right, awesome, thank you. Thank you. It is like a marathon run for the, uh, for the 2-year-old visit, so. Yeah, I'm. Yeah, I had to, it was like a little quiz for myself. I love it. Great. Well, I am actually using my own tablet today, so I have a note-taking app so that I can, oh, we did this for Grace. Yeah. So I can, I don't have to type as much. So awesome. What questions do you guys have today? She will, like, on the last bite of food, she'll, like, hold it in her mouth for the last sip. It's not all of it, it's not like every bite she does, it's just like the last one. That's pretty normal, yeah, as long as she's otherwise following fine and mechanics of eating seem to be okay, that's, yeah, okay. Definitely you can encourage her to take that last swallow and look in her mouth when she's done eating, but not uncommon, that kid will do that for sure. You just want a little snack for later, right? Yeah. But then sometimes she'll just be like, you know, just like. Uh-huh. And it throws you a little nuts, but. Yeah, so definitely not one of the less annoying things that mothers will do, but very. But hurtful. Yeah. As long as it's normal, I mean, I can handle. Yeah. The minor running runs. Uh-huh.

So awesome. Other questions that you guys had? Wait, you had some? Yeah, well, daycare wants to introduce potty training. Uh-huh. And- We're wondering how to even start with that because she hasn't expressed a ton of like interest with this but then at daycare they said that she was like super interested one day. Oh. So, I don't know. Okay, well, I would say biggest kind of predictor of success with potty training is kids' investment in it. Yeah. Maybe if you guys aren't noticing a ton of interest at home, do you have like a little potty or anything for her yet? No, we haven't even got anything yet. Okay, so you could start really simple with just getting a little potty and kind of putting it in her play area, so something that she can just kind of get comfortable- with so it doesn't feel scary, and then just kind of see how she does with it, and if she is showing interest in sitting, or if she's showing interest in getting out of diapers and things like that, definitely. Well we've got, so when they said it that day, because she, she'll say like poop when she's pooping. Uh-huh. And so that same day we brought her home and she said poop, I was like you gotta go poop? Uh-huh. And she was saying it and so. I took off her diaper and there wasn't anything in there, but I sat her down. Mm-hmm. And she farted, but she didn't poop. Okay. She didn't freak out or anything. Good, good, yeah. So she may be, she may be well ready. But we haven't really done anything since then either. Yeah, yeah. And with potty training, there's about a million different strategies of how to potty train out there, and like honestly, they're all fine. So if you're kind of reading through different things on the internet, whatever seems logistically like it makes the most sense to you guys is fine with me. And yeah, and the biggest thing with potty training is whatever strategy you kind of decide to go with, just kind of stick to it. And if you get into it and you realize like she is really not into this, like this is, she's just not feeling ready or like interested in doing it, it is totally fine to take a break for a few weeks and try again. Okay, yeah, it's like the typical time that you like to see them fully pod trained. Oh man, so I would say, um, I don't have- What's that? We're touching the third rail. You're doing great. We just turned 2, right? Yeah. So this is actually on the early side for sure. So most kids are somewhere between kind of 2 and 3 on potty training, but It's not necessarily like a major, you know, it's not like a developmental milestone in the sense that some of the other things are like if you're not potty trained by 3, you're delayed or something like that, so. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So I would say, yeah, and then coordinate with daycare as well, like when you guys are kind of starting, let them know so they can try and be consistent there when she's in, but yeah.

Okay, the one I had was we, obviously the baby's like a big adjustment. Yes. The new move was huge. That's right, yes. Yeah, and She seems to be adjusting okay. Mm-hmm. And she's still in her crib, but when she goes to the crib, she's going to the taller bed. Yeah, yeah. So it's like a lot of, like, kind of big changes. Yeah, lots of transitions. Yeah. Yeah. Is there, like, ways to help her adjust? Navigate that? Yeah. So- I would say for the crib and toddler bed transition, if you can, maybe try and prioritize getting Emma into her toddler bed while the crib is still empty as much as you can so it's not like a... this is not yours anymore, this is a little kind of feel. Okay. So that can be a good strategy, obviously like some kids do great with like little kid moving into into their kind of space, but I would say that might be a good strategy. Big change. And then trying to do kind of one big change at a time can be helpful to, And then also just realizing like with big changes, there's often some behavioral regression and things like that too, and that's all normal and expected, so.

That's what I'm noticing is just like food has been a little different. Uh-huh. Because we were talking about it, she used to be such like the best trier. of everything. Yeah. And now it just feels like it's full swing toddler. It's a lot of nose. Yeah. It's a fight of like barely eating. Mm-hmm. I mean, she's not starving, obviously. No, her growth looks great. So, yeah, and some of that could be transition, some of that could be, that's just the state she's at right now. So, toddlers will often literally exist on air for a few days in a row and then like eat more than you do the next day and that's all very normal. Okay. As long as she's getting a decent variety, like if you look at like this week, did we get some fruits and vegetables and proteins and fats and greens, and she's doing most of those food groups most weeks. you really are in a pretty good spot as far as kind of nutrition goes. So yeah, and it could be that that regression you're seeing is something that'll kind of go away as she adjusts. It could also just be the She's 2 and this is what some kids do when they're 2. Yeah. We're trying not to make like a big deal out of it and make it bigger than what it is. Yeah. But it's just like. Where's the balance? Yeah, yeah. But we're not like too worried about it, it's just like, just one of those things. Yeah, mm-hmm, yep. But definitely just wanted to talk to you about it because we're just. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so as far as foods go, just keep putting those good choices in front of her and she'll get there, and you are never in charge of like making her eat certain things or making her eat a certain amount, like that's always up to her, you just kind of make that stuff available to her.

Because when we give toddlers the opportunity to be stubborn, they will win, huh? Yeah. Win. All right, yeah. Other questions that you guys have? Okay, was there one more? I think it might have been one more, but I can't remember. Yeah, I can't remember either. Okay, I can go through my questions and then if you think of it or if it's related, just let me know. Okay. So, last wellness visit, we had done that referral over to Infant Toddler. Did you guys ever connect with them? We did. Yeah, and how did things go there? She has the flying pillows. Yeah. She like wasn't even worried. Okay, perfect. She was like, she's doing things that are borderline like three, so. Perfect, love that. She's like, you guys are denied. Awesome. But we were cool with that. Good, yeah, best case scenario, so always good to be careful with that, so. Awesome, did you guys have any concerns about her development, kind of left over now? Yeah, I feel like that's taken on. You're right, it was like the lucky charm to get her to talk was just. Uh-huh. Setting that up and then of course she just started talking and started going crazy. Awesome. You hit your explosion period. She did hit an explosion period.

I love it. There you go. Great. There you go. She is meeting expectations beautifully for that developmental screener that we had you guys fill out, and then her autism screener is also full and all, so all looking good today. Yay! Yeah, and then nutrition we talked about a little bit, did you guys have any kind of leftover questions about nutrition at all? I don't think so. Probably need to do a better job at just giving her the right things, but. Yeah. But it's not that she, yeah. Just. Yeah. Good for improvement. You have two young kids.

do your best, but life is life too. Especially with like just moving. Yeah. And the kitchen's not unpacked yet. Oh for sure, totally hear you. So it's like. Yeah. Huh, Burger Point is really close. Yeah. Sometimes Deli Express sneaks in. Yeah. Not always, just that all the time, but it's just. Yeah, for sure. It's the easier, the easy option. Absolutely. I totally hear you. So do your best. She still doesn't usually eat it anyways. Perfect. Do your best and also give yourself some grace. For sure. I got to eat that last night too. And I didn't just move. Yeah, oh my goodness, look at this, Emma. Look at that. Can you do this? Look at that. So you want to try? No. Yeah, try it. Almost. Almost. Good swan effects though. Yeah. Oh, Jake, you're pooping, okay? Mm-hmm. Good, good. And is she doing her tooth brushing? Pretty cute. That's pretty good. Awesome. Great. So doing well there and then I can't remember if I've given you guys my like dentist spiel or not yet. I don't know if you have, but we're interested because we talked about it. Yeah, so most family dentists will start seeing kids around like 2 to 3 years old, some of them 4. A pediatric dentist will see her now if you guys wanted to. A lot of those first visits are not. true innerness cleanings. They're just getting used to the space and the atmosphere and things like that. So whatever kind of feels like a better fit for you guys.

I think the big advantage to getting established with Community Health earlier is just if heaven forbid she slash a tooth or something like that we have a place where she's been already to go for kind of emergency stuff so yeah you're going down there oh goodness great you're just hanging out And then it looks like she's sleeping pretty well. Mm-hmm. Good. Awesome. Even with the big change, I love it. Yeah. Good. And then for just kind of general safety type stuff, any questions you guys have about car seat safety, safety around the house that's worth- get moved in, sun and water type stuff? If we're ever really worried, we have like this, it almost looks like a UFC octagon. Uh-huh. But it's like this octagon that folds out and has a little band inside. Okay. So if we're ever like really concerned and we're doing something and we can't really keep an eye on her, we'll just. Love it. Plop her in there. Yeah. Beautiful. Throw some toys in there, throw Bluey on and. Awesome. Great. But we don't pull, not very often, it's just when. Yeah. Like you have to do something. Yeah, you've got to unpack the box or you're both distracted or something. Yeah. Yeah, I love that plan. So, great. I love what you guys are on it. And then for exercise counseling at this age, she obviously doesn't need to be in any like organized sports or things at this point. We do see exercise that's super closely related to her spending time, so if you're keeping that to like no more than an hour-ish a day, she's going to get all the exercise she needs, so.

Awesome. All right, well, I'll show you where she's at with growth. Oh, and I made a note to myself because I have a bunch of stuff left over in her problem list that I've just been bad about deleting. She is not having constipation anymore, correct? No. Okay, we're resolving it. Her hemangioma. Not a concern. Not a concern, is that? I think it's gone, her hair would be covering it if it was, but. Yeah, but it looked super close. Mm-hmm. Okay, well. But it was starting to fade pretty good when it was starting to get grown over. Perfect. Perfect, so we'll resolve that. Hey, do you have any leftover concerns about her head shape? No. Okay. I think her ears are a little, just like one's farther back than the other, about as far as. Loose. That's, but I feel like I kind of split my hair. Yeah. It's just the one thing, but it came out pretty good. Yeah, I'm just going to look good. Yeah, she's looking pretty good there. Sweet. All right, and then is she still having a lot of eczema issues or is that kind of, can you pass that to her? Beautiful. Look at that. I just deleted everything on her problem list. So I'm glad I remembered to do that because I almost forgot again. So okay, now looking at her growth, she is doing- fantastic with her weight here, so falling very consistently along her red line here. And then if we look at her height, she had a nice girl spurt since last time, so she's looking awesome. She is up to 67th percentile, so looking great there. Weight and length together, we're still very consistent with those proportion, so looking beautiful there. And then head circumference, she's looking awesome as well. Heart rate, oxygen level, breathing, and temperature look good, so all of her numbers are right where they should be.

Nice. Yeah. All right, Miss Emma, I'm going to get all cleaned up and we'll take a closer look at you, okay? Do you need it cleaned up? Here. You want to take this? You want to drink? I think she has some in her mouth. Oh, I don't know. Take a drink. Thank you. Not so fast. Okay, I'm coming Emma. Not so fast. I'm coming. All right, just swallow your water. Swallow. Swallow. There you go. Look at this, Emma. Do you want to check it out? What is that? It's my stethoscope. We're going to use that to touch your skin. It doesn't hurt at all. It's just like this. Yeah, you want to try? Awesome. And now I'm going to put it right here on your chest so that I can listen to your heart. Emma's turn. I love it. Yeah, and I can hear your hand. Now let's try right there. So let's put it like right. Here. Oh, good job, Mia. Yeah. Whoa, sounding good. Yeah. Let's put it right here now, Emma. Can you put it right there? I'm going to scoot it up just a little bit. Good job. Hold it there. Awesome. I have to listen a little longer than that. A little bit longer kiddo. Hold it there. There we go, and I'm going to swoop right here. Hold it there Emma. You're doing great Emma. Here we go, let's do this. Yeah, good job. Awesome. All right, we're going to do the same thing on your back. Good job. You're doing great. You're doing good. Okay, let's see. Now let's try my light. Look at this. Whoa, look at that. Do you want to, should I shine it on your hand? Can I show you? Whoa. Look at that. Look. It's right on your leg. Whoa. I'm going to use this to look at your eyes. Here we go. Perfect. And now I've got another light here. This is more of a normal flashlight. See? Wow. I'm going to use that to look at your eyes. Good job. Yeah. And now look at this trick. Whoa. Do you want to try? Oh my goodness. Whoa. Look at your finger glow. That looks so cool. Yeah. I'm going to have you watch my leg go up. Good job, and down, and over to the side, and up, we're going to go all the way over here, good job, there we go, beautiful, just checking on your head, perfect, and then your nose. Great. And then, Emma, do you think you have any butterflies in your ears today? What do you think? Let's check your ears. Where's your ears? Let's look at this ear. Let's see. 1, 2, 3. Good job. Oh, no butterflies there. Let's look on this side. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Great! No butterflies there. I'm going to check on your neck here. Just a little tinkle, tinkle, tinkle. Good job. All right, my dear, I'm going to get some gloves on here. And this is still just my hands in here. Do you want to touch? Yeah, see? I'm going to do high fives. Nice. Knuckles. Yeah. All right, my dear, I'm going to have you lay down, okay? Can you lay down? This part can feel a little scary. Mom and dad are still right here with you, though. Yeah, you're doing great. You're doing great. Let's get your little propeller out of here. There we go. I'm just peeking at your mouth here. Go, ah. Ah, good job. We're checking on your tummy. Good job, Zoe. Good job. You are doing such an awesome job. All right, look at normal there. Great. And let's just check on those hips. Can you bend your knees for me, kiddo? There we go. Awesome. That was it, my dear.

Yay. You killed it. That's all I got for you. Yay. I'm going to get your clothes back on. I'm going to put your clothes on. All right. We are up to date on shots. So she's in great shape. Yay. Anything you missed or other questions you have left over? I don't think so. Oh good. The dentist was the one that I got reminded of going through, but. Yeah, yeah, you bet. So you guys just had a big move, there's no huge rush on it, but good to have on your radar. Yeah. Yeah. So awesome. I had a pretty good dental through my work, so. Oh sweet. Good, good. Yeah. So next scheduled visit for her would be- about six months from now, so a two and a half year visit, and that is going to be right in the middle of maternity leave for me. So, when you're getting scheduled, they'll probably offer to do it with Tara Jenkins as the nurse practitioner working over here, I don't know if you've met her yet. Wait, say that again, I think I missed something. So I am out on maternity leave starting in June. Whoa! Yeah! Congrats! Thank you. So Emma's next wellness visit will be in- beginning of August-ish, and so Brianna, I will still be out at that point, so Brianna would probably be the person to see her, and she was absolutely fabulous, she did a great job. So, yeah. Well, congratulations. Thank you very much. Yeah. So, I don't want you to get to scheduling and be like, wait, what? Yeah. So, yeah. Can you fly like a butterfly? Awesome. Can you fly like a butterfly? Fine. Emma, you did such a good job today. Where's your socks? Let's put your socks on. Yeah, let's help mom and dad get all packed up.

E66.3 Overweight","Hey. Hi, doc. How you doing? Pretty good. All right. Your heart's been behaving itself? Well, it seems to. I was short of breath. I was in the hospital a couple months ago. Okay. I had, when I had back surgery, I had, they went in and had to remove some metal that I had from previous surgery. Okay. And my incision wouldn't heal. So he put me on one of those wound bags and seems to be doing really good now. But I had, I don't know, I had, I think through the fires and the smoke and the stuff, I had a, Dr. Carter put me in the hospital for 2 weeks and, you know, he said I was short of breath and stuff. Okay. And so, but he said my heart seemed good. Okay, did he put you on water pills or?

Yeah, I'm on water pills and I got 2 or 3 antibiotics from my back deal, but yeah, I'm on a 2 a day water pill. Okay, that looks good. Okay, let me take a listen to you. Okay. Sounds pretty good. All right. Doing okay with your medicine? Yeah, seems to be. Okay. And blood pressure looks good. Your heart rate's a little fast today. Is it normally running that high? Well, probably because I went, you know, went and checked in over there. Over there and they made you walk around. I walk all the way around. I didn't know whether I was going to make it in time, but I come in the door over there and they see me panting and puffing and put me in a wheelchair and push me up here, but yeah, I just need to get out and build it up.

Okay, yeah, you've been down for a while, so. Yeah. Any questions for me today? No, other than, you know, just. Just a routine checkup, right? Yeah, make sure that everything's okay. Okay, I think things look good. Okay. So we'll just plan on seeing you back in a year. All right. Ow. That hurt. I should fix those a little bit more. Yeah, so the stuff doesn't come off. Yeah, that's not good, so. Anything else I need to do other than just? No, I think you're on the right medicines, blood pressure looks good, so. Okay. Try and get more active. Okay. Let's build your stamina back up, get you stronger. Yeah, I got a, I've got a Swin bike that I try to ride. That you use? And then they got me a bunch of exercises with my legs and stuff. Okay. I just need to try to figure out how to drop this weight. Yeah. You're diabetic? Yeah. Did they try the like Ozempic or Mounjaro medicines with you? No. Talk to your doctor about those. Those are newer medicines. You've probably seen them on the news. Yeah, I've seen them. you'd be the perfect patient for them because they help with diabetes, they help you with the heart. Most of the time, the weight loss medicines before are really bad for the heart. Yeah. And these ones are really good, so these are good medicines for it, and you should qualify for it because of the diabetes. Yeah. And then it's a medicine that mimics your gut hormones, so the hormone that tells, that your stomach sends to your brain to say we're full, and so Your brain thinks you're false, you're not- so your arm is hungry, and when you eat, you get full faster, and your stomach stays full faster, so you don't eat as much, and that helps you lose the weight, helps bring your blood sugars down, so.

I've seen on TV that Golo, they say. The what? Golo, G-O-L-O. Golo, yeah. It's supposed to have a medicine that takes, they said they're. Yeah. But, you know, I don't know whether it's just a scam or. Probably a scam. Yeah. I would see what your doctor says about the Ozempic. Yeah, see, I'll have to talk to my diabetes educator at East Valley Clinic. I get all, where I'm Native American, I get all of my medication at Lake Ridge. Oh, okay. At the reservation up there, and the government won't let them have that stuff. Oh. I'm using Novolog and Oh. Levemir and stuff. Oh, okay. But I'll check with my diabetes educator and see if. See if they can get those? Some way if my Medicare will cover some of that. Yeah, because those being. I mentioned a client to the doctor up there, and he said they cost about 400 bucks a pen. Well, yeah, these are the ones that can be expensive too, but your insurance should cover more of it because you're diabetic. A lot of people aren't diabetic and they're still using them because for weight loss. Well, I'll have her check on it and see if, you know, if I'm diabetic, I'd rather go that way to lose some weight. Because that'll help you make it so you can move around better. Yeah. lots of the good things for it. So hopefully over the years, the price will come down on them a bit too, so. Hopefully one of these days we'll think. Thank you, Steve. I'm glad you're doing so well. Yeah. So right up there by those papers there on the wall. Okay. [inaudible]",,,

F41.9 Anxiety
R44.0 Auditory hallucinations
F43.10 PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder)","Casey's a 16-year-old female here for follow-up on suicide ideation, anxiety, depression, and hallucinations. Uses she/her pronouns. Hello? Hi Casey, can you hear me? Yeah. How are you? I'm good. Yeah? How was last night after you left the ER?

It was good. Yeah? Yeah. Did you have a rough night like you did the night before with kind of not being able to sleep, hearing voices, or how were you feeling? I fell right asleep. You fell right asleep? Yeah. Okay, how do you think you're doing today? You just broke up. Any, what is bothering you most right now? I don't know what the hallucinations do. Yeah, yeah. And like the voices. Yeah, okay. Is that something that you're noticing kind of constantly throughout the day? Yeah. Okay. Is it something that keeps you up at night? [inaudible] sometimes. Okay.

Have they changed in terms of what they're saying to you? What have the whispers been saying to you recently? I can't really like. I quite understand what it's saying. Okay, okay. It's not telling you to hurt yourself in any way? No. Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself? No. Okay.

Okay, so I think your mom talked with Jordan a little bit earlier and there's a couple of things that I think we need to To kind of figure out, I think certainly I put a referral into psychiatry and so they are the mental health doctors, the brain doctors, they are the experts at figuring out why you are having these. these hallucinations. And hallucinations are just different perceptions of reality, right? So hearing things that maybe other people aren't hearing or seeing things that other people aren't seeing, it doesn't make them any less real. It doesn't make them any less scary. And I think it's going to be really important to continue to talk with your mom about how often you're feeling these things or experiencing this, what they are saying, if what they say... changes, if it becomes more clear, if it becomes more scary, those are all things that we really want you to be checking in with your mom to let us know. There are some medications that can help with with hallucinations and so things like Abilify and things like risperidone are two medications that we often use. It sounds like with the The chat that you had with Jordan, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you had been on Abilify before? Yes. Okay. Was that for the hallucinations as well before? No, just for mood stabilizer. Okay, okay. Did you notice any improvement with that at all? No. Okay. Morgan, did you notice anything different? No, I actually was nervous with her being on it because it made me gain weight, like I gained like 10 pounds in a week.

Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Um, so. I tried with Spiridone before and that seemed to be okay. That seemed to be okay? Yeah. Okay. So why don't we, because it sounds like we're not interested in inpatient anymore. Is that right? Yeah, she just felt like, how do you explain what you felt like? I feel like it would almost make me feel worse in a way. Okay, okay. Okay, and I think we want to make sure that we are kind of involving you as much as possible, and if it's something that you're not sure we can do as much as we can kind of outpatient until, you know. and try to do as much as we can to get you feeling more stable and to get you feeling in a better place. I think the Lexapro, Sounds like you've been tolerating it okay. I think the challenge with the changes that you're feeling and the Lexapro, Lexapro usually isn't a medication that's going to cause you to have hallucinations or to hear things or to change things. So I think one thing that I would probably recommend before we start, I don't like to do 2 medication changes at once, because if we change your Lexapro dosing and we start some Risperidone, then we don't really know what's working and what isn't working, or if the Lexapro dosing is the problem or not, I think there's still a lot of anxiety, there's still a lot of depression, depressed mood. And so I think I would like to keep the Lexapro where we're at for now and try the Risperidone and do a very close follow up with you like in a week and see how we are doing.

You know how to get a hold of me through my chart. So if anything changes. We want reports, so we want you to let us know how you're feeling on it. We want to know if you feel like it's helping a little bit with how you're The voices that you're hearing, the whispering, the seeing the shadows, all of those things, we want to know. It can take a little bit of time to really work, and so I want to give it a fair shake. We also want to start with the lowest amount of medicine possible and really work our way up if we need to. So we usually start at really low doses to make sure that the medicine isn't going to hurt you more than it's helping you. It is a medicine that we usually take at night. It makes a lot of people sleepy. And so sometimes we'll use it, especially if you're really kind of struggling, like sometimes when our mood is not super stable and we're feeling sad or depressed or anxious, nighttime falling asleep kind of relaxing our body and our brain and our mind can be really hard to do, and so This is a medication that you take right before bedtime, and it helps with that as well. Okay. Okay. And it sounds like you've had it before. You don't remember having any negative effects with it? I don't remember having any negative effects with it.

Yeah. Okay. Okay. You haven't had it before. I've had it. Oh, got it. Okay, okay, got it, okay. Morgan, did you have any negative effects with it or any issues with it? No. Okay, okay. And then did- Jordan go through different options in terms of more intensive therapies? More intensive therapies? Yes, and we are going to reach out to her old therapist. Okay. She was going to start a little over a year ago, she was going to start EMDR. Is that right? Great. Sorry, I think that's what it's called. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Therapy. Yeah. And I think that would be, like, a great option for Casey because she just tries to block out her trauma instead of working through it.

Yeah. Yeah. So I think that I'm going to get a hold of her tomorrow and just place her on that spot. Okay, perfect. And see if that works. Sounds good. Sounds good. So let's plan to touch base in about a week. Does that sound good? Sorry, there's like a big echo here. I don't know if you guys are hearing that too. Yeah, that's good. We do have a doctor's appointment with you on the 9th. Oh, perfect. Okay. Well, why don't we just keep that, and then if we need to change things, so there is, we're starting with 0.5 of the risperidone, so it's the smallest dose. I want you to keep me posted just in terms of how you're tolerating it, Casey, how you feel with it, if you notice any differences, good or bad. And then we do have the ability to go up on that if you're doing well with it, but not noticing a significant change in terms of. the hallucinations. And so if you're tolerating it well, after 3 or 4 days, we can talk about going up. But I really want to start with the lowest dose and see. And then we can kind of make other changes if we need to, depending on how you're doing.

Okay. Okay. Any other questions that either of you have for me? No. Okay and we have the Walmart on Newstick right? Yes. Okay so I will send this over to the pharmacy right now and then we'll put the referral into psychiatry to get you plugged in with them. Okay, thank you. Okay. Thank you. You are so welcome, and then we'll plan to see you next week, but I'll keep an eye out for my chart messages from you depending on how things are going, okay? Okay, sounds good. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good night. You too. Thanks. Bye. Thank you.",,,

J35.2 Adenoid hypertrophy","You bumped your head. Yes, you did. I got that from a friend. I got that from a friend. I got that from a friend. I got both of them. Was that long for a minute? What's going on today, my friend? We've got this rash that comes and goes. It's been happening for months. I think it's from drooling a lot. The thing about the drooling is he has all of his teeth, so we're wondering if it's maybe allergies or something like that. Sometimes he's drooling. Really? Yes. How old are you? Two. Two, and how many months? He'll be three in June, so we're getting close to a three.

Speech development's pretty good. Mm-hmm. That's what I worry about with speech control. Oh, okay. Okay, because sometimes it's annoying, really, because they're all mouth breathers and I've never developed proper motion. I'm kind of trying to change his speech. Yeah. Come on up here, buddy. The doctor's seeing you. So how long has this been going on? Several months, and, you know, we just keep thinking it's going to pass. We've tried, you know, Aquaform. We've also tried Diaper Cream on it. It sort of works, but it'll always come back. And does he drool when he's asleep? Yeah, I think so. And nowhere else? Nope, just that spot on the right, and it's always the one side, too, on the right side. Never gets worse than this? Maybe a little bit. So, yeah, this is a nonspecific dermatitis, and you're 99% likely you're absolutely right. This is from drooling. Yeah.

When skin is moist for too long, when it finally dries out, it dries out drier than it would be before you had gotten it wet. It just, like, leaches the moisture out of it. And when the skin gets that dry, it just gets inflamed. Yeah. And then when it gets inflamed, it loses more moisture by evaporation. And what do you got? More dryness. And what happens? You get more inflammation. But you're on the right track. This is like a kid or an adult with eczema. Okay. This isn't quite eczema. This is more or less water-related. I'm allergic to water. Skin just gets too wet. Okay. And it's a matter of management. When's the last time you put anything on? We didn't do anything last night, so it would have been the night before. So you put the Aquaphor on at night? Yeah, or a diaper cream. Mm-hmm. I don't know. Let's talk about the Aquaphor. Tonight, Aquaphor. Don't be shy. Okay. Okay? It's going to get all over everything. That's the problem. Yeah. And then it's like, I can't get that stuff out. Yeah. But what are you going to do? Yeah. You know, there's something out. Nah, his mouth is too close up. If it was on his arm or something, you'd actually put Aquaphor and put a gauze over it, a large one, and tape around it to seal in everything. But we can't do that with his mouth right there. Yeah. Let's say after tomorrow, I want you to put a little bit of 1% hydrocortisone cream. A little bit of counter grade. Okay. Cream? Cream? Cream? Put that on and rub it in until you can. you can't see it, and then put the Aquaphor over it again. Okay. Okay, do that at night. What are you doing in the daytime? Nothing for it. I'd probably do the same thing, at least the Aquaphor during the daytime. Okay. The more time it has a moisture barrier on it, which Aquaphor it is, the quicker this will heal. Okay. Okay, you're talking a week, and it's gonna look better, but you're right. Yeah. It's probably gonna come back. Yeah, okay. Until he stops drooling.

But overall, it's no big deal. Do we expect him to stop drooling at a certain age? Probably by kindergarten. Okay. Okay. Can I listen to your heart? Okay. Who is that? Do you know his name? I'm listening to your heart. No owies. Do you like dinosaurs? No. Do you know all those guys? Yeah. What's the dog's name? Okay, what's his name? Who is that? Is it Cement or is it Woody? Yeah, I know this guy's name. Do you know his name? Who is that? Do you know who that is? Buzz Lightyear. Does he snore? Not usually, but he's kind of a mouth breather. Do you have a lot of ear infections? He had a handful, but it wasn't the threshold where they were going to consider tubes, but we were getting a little nervous about that. Does he attend the daycare or anything? Yes. Can I get you to sit right here, buddy? Come on. Right here? Okay. Can I get you to sit right here, buddy? Come on. Right here? Come on up. The reason I'm wondering about this is that I've really been dealing with a lot of kids I've seen with troubling eye health for years because they have adenoidal hypertrophy or tonsils, enlarged tonsils on top of it, and kids with that tend to snore, they tend to drool, and they tend to get ear infections. Okay. Yeah, it's been a while since his last ear infection. And attending daycare, that says a lot, you know? Because I know he can't avoid colds. Cool. Is he running the show in daycare? No, he actually is very quiet there.

At home, he's... But only recently, he started talking more at school, so I didn't know what that says about me or my personality. Take your tongue out. Can you make a noise like that? What do you want to do when you grow up? Yeah, his passage through there, it's a little constricted. I wouldn't be surprised if he has some adenoidal hypertrophy, but, you know, with what's going on, I'm not sure that's enough to justify doing anything about it. yeah okay what we want if the snoring gets worse okay if he is constantly in a uh mouth breather and does he see a dentist we haven't done yet let's see dentist number one it's time yeah number two often they're the ones who can tell what's going on with the jaw development okay okay they're all they're worried more about you know malocclusion for the teeth and what have you but if somebody's constantly a mouth breather they say yeah sometimes the jaw can grow a little funny okay and they're they're often the ones who pick it up okay okay is that something that can be fixed if it's if it is happening with the hypertrophy with the jaw the jaw generally you take care of the and everything will grow okay okay and hypertrophy is the the swelling it's it's the adenoids are glands actually they're kind of glandular tissue related to the immune system and they are up under the soft palate you can't see them okay you infer their their enlargement by lots of your infections and the oral pharynx just appears like it's kind of closed it appears like the roof is kind of lower than most most kids his tonsils are generous they're not huge okay if you see him snoring okay and this is still a problem that the drilling will have you see him snoring um a lot take a video audio and and video okay make a point bring it back in let's take a look okay okay you know what's good about today no shots yeah that's really cool isn't it are you ready to go yeah you're gonna be all done no because you have knuckles you know what you look like you look like you need stickers you can get stickers on the way out okay i need to get some stickers and then we're gonna get a snack yeah okay that was snack yeah open the stickers are up at the front desk yep we'll go look okay up there okay thank you thank you you I um you",,,

I'm just going to let you know beforehand, I've got a new technology that I'm trying out. It's called, it's an AI. It helps me to take notes. So it just listens to the visit and helps to take more accurate notes. So it's kind of cool. But I just thought I'd let you know. What's it called? It's called Ambience AI Scribe. We have one at work. Oh, do you? Yeah. Oh, gotcha.

Where do you work? Medix Care. Oh, at Medix Care. What is the scribe? I can't remember what it's called. We just started it. Oh, really? But yeah, you can use it. It's kind of cool. Yeah, I've been doing it just since Monday. And man, it really like all sorts of stuff that like normally we talk about like, oh, and what about this? And what about this? It like pulls it, it picks up on it. And then like when we talk about like, yeah, like your AI scribe that you use at your work, it's going to cut that out. And it cuts out like when we talk about your grandkids or your vacation you took and everything. It's really cool. So it's been awesome. So we're trying to get the kinks out and everything.

So anyway, do you have any concerns or anything that you wanted to talk about today? Yeah. So I have in this breast, it's like a lump, but it's like a big mass. Okay. How long has it been there? For a while, like over a month. Over a month, you notice it? Yeah. Is it painful or tender? It has been at certain points. It's been tender and stuff. Okay. And it's like, like this one's not like that at all. Okay. But this one has like a big. You can feel a little lump in there. Yeah, you can like see. Kind of push it around and everything. So I'm worried about that. Yeah, let's take a look.

We'll do a breast exam when I do the exam, so I'll have you undressed for that one. When was your last mammogram? You had one a year ago. Yeah. And have you had abnormal mammograms? No. Nope. So you're due anyway, but let's take a look. Family history. Any family history of breast cancer? Nothing like that. Are you, you said that sometimes it's tender. Are you noticing any like skin changes? Like can you see it? Like if you look in the mirror, do you see like a puckering or anything? No, I looked. Yeah, last night I looked and it's hanging here now. So, but I was like, you know, to see if it popped out. It wasn't popping out. But if I go like this. No discharge. Then you can see it. No, no discharge. Okay. I'm sure it's just like the gland or something. Well, and if it's mobile, like you're like, I can push you around. That right there is reassuring to me. But yeah, for sure. Let's take a look and check and sounds like it's time to update the mammogram. So, okay. But we'll see what it's showing.

Other than that, any other concerns? No. Okay.

I'm doing the weight loss thing. Oh. What is it called? Oh, the somagmatite? Yeah. Yep. And that's going really well. You're tolerating it okay? Yeah. I mean, the day that I do it, it's usually I get really nauseated. Okay. But. Where are you doing that? Am I? Are you getting it from? Yeah. Oh, it just fall off. Is it not on there? No, it must have fallen off. I saw it on your list. I thought I saw it, but that's your estriol. And so it must have dropped off. And so I'm like, I thought I was, but then I'm like, maybe lots of people are going to these other clinics all around. Let me pull that up and see. Do you remember how many units you're doing? 20. You're on 20. Oh, okay. So my friend's doing 50. So this one, it can go up eventually to 50. It really just depends on how you're tolerating it. how well it's working.

I have about 10 more pounds I want to lose than that. And then you feel like you're, yeah, you're BMI, you're 26. What's a good BMI? So, normally we say between 20 and 25 is normal. Okay. You're not there yet, but after 65, then we start saying between 23 and 28. So, I really am not encouraging people, like, you got to get down to 20. But, yeah, you're getting close to... Yeah. So, when I did, because I did Octavius, and I did really good, I loved it. But, like, I felt like my face was, like, sunk in. And I don't feel that with this, which I, you know, which is good because I didn't, like, I got to this weight and I was like, I don't want to lose it. I look terrible. Like, but this makes, I mean, I don't feel a little bit, but not so sickly. I mean, I had people say, you need to quit losing weight, you're too skinny. And this has been better. Yeah, because you can eat just regular food, like normal food and everything. How are you doing as far as, do you feel like, other than just cutting down how much you're eating, are you making changes?

Are you eating a fairly healthy diet, do you feel like? Yeah, like, in the morning I either have a yogurt or a fruit. And then, I try and get two fruits a day. So, then in the afternoon I have a fruit. I have those little nut, it's nut and berries and cheese. Okay. Usually in the afternoon. Yeah. And then I eat a regular dinner. Like, with half of what I used to eat, but... But, like, a meat and a protein or something like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Always, but it's just not, like, over a meal. Right, yeah. Which is good. And it helps really kind of curb that, give you that portion control. And usually when I go to the, like, if we go out to eat, I usually eat, like, half of my meal. I always take something. Take it home, yeah. But now, it's like, I eat a half of that. Uh-huh. Which, I mean... You really, with these GLP ones, you realize how giant-sized restaurant meals are anymore. And, I mean, it's pretty stark, like, when they look and show comparisons between, like, what it was, say, even in, like, the 1980s when you went out to get it, and, like, the size of, like, fast food, like, the size of burgers and everything, and size of everything. Everything has really oversized. And when you, like, spend 20 bucks on a meal at a restaurant, it's like a good three, four meals. Like, you know, it's pretty amazing. And that's what I've always said, like, when I'm, because I don't, I've always just, like, half my meal. Uh-huh. And now, like, when I'm forking it, I'm like, whoa, that's just, and I'm fine with it. And I know this medicine has a lot to do with that. Right. But it's nice to not feel, like, full all the time. Yeah. And I don't, I'm not, like, a big fry person or anything. So, like, I have just been more aware of just, like, getting a salad, a side salad instead of the fries. Yeah. I don't. So, trying to add more plants, like, more toppings. Yeah, I've never been, I've always been someone that does, like, chicken and broccoli. And, you know, I've always liked the food groups. Yeah. And I've kind of stayed away. You know, the bread, of course, gets to me sometimes. But for the most part, I mean, it's been going.

But you had told me that if I'm on it, like, I need to stay on it. So, yes and no. How does that work? What do you mean? So, yeah.

So, the studies show that people do, if they stop it, we do see weight regain. Yeah. But it's not as, yeah, it's not as quickly as, say, with other weight loss medications. Like, Phentermine, I see a pretty rapid weight regain. So, there's a study looking at semaglutide and they followed patients for two years after they had stopped it. And during, they'd been on it on average for 18 months to lose weight, and the weight loss, average weight loss was about 17% of their body weight. And then two years later, after they had stopped it, they still were weighed less than when they started, but they had, on average, gained back about 11 of the 17% that they had lost. So, what I currently am taking from that and what the kind of expert opinion out there, that's basically what we've got to go, because we don't have long-term, you know, here's the best practice, here are the guidelines, is I'm leaving a little bit up to patients, how you're feeling. Do you feel like you've made significant lifestyle changes where you feel like you want to try to continue to manage this on, you know, with diet and exercise and watching those portion sizes? And if you kind of know, hey, this is really all my body needs to function and I've been able to maintain and I'm staying stable, then we can go ahead and try stopping it. But we're not gonna just abandon it and just be like, oh, see ya, and if you get back where you were, come back. I mean, it's, really, I would watch it, and then if you start putting on a little weight, you put on five or 10, then we maybe would go back on for a few months, go back, bring it back down. So that's one option, and that's probably gonna save you money overall. You still probably are gonna use it as a tool. Because you go out and eat. Yeah. Like, I buy those little things for lunch, I'm not having to go out and grab something for lunch or, you know, something like that. So you're saving a ton on your grocery bill. You really save more money. Right. Because I took it out of my grocery money, that's where I'm taking it out of, and we're still okay, you know? So, yeah, so. I don't see where, I mean, it's a matter of how you look at it.

Yeah, and there are some people who are just saying, like, look, I've struggled my whole life, this has been something that constantly had that food noise, and I just, and I'm finally, you know, controlling it, and so. It's okay to stay on it? It's okay to stay on it, yes. Okay, so they just lower it down to, like, one? That's another, that's what we can do, too. If you wanna try a lower dose and see if you maintain okay on the lower dose, we can back off and try a little lower dose. I don't now, but I'm thinking in the future, how could that work? Well, so if I have a patient, so. Say I've been on it two years. You've been on it two years, say you get that next 10 pounds off, you're one, say, let's say 145, you've been maintaining at 145, happy at that weight, and you're like, I wanna try going off of it. We just stop it, cold turkey. You don't have to taper down. This is not one that you're gonna have withdrawal from. So there's no need to taper it down, and if you go off of it and say you watch it and over the next three months or so you put on another five pounds and you wanna, like, I wanna go back, I don't wanna, I wanna stay on it, we can actually start you on a low dose again, start you back at the starting dose, and if that starting dose, or even bump it up a little bit, maintains and you're doing okay, we can do that. So if I want to, like, I've lost the weight I wanna lose, can I just go down to, like, one and just maintain that? That's another thing you could do. That's what I'm looking more for. Yeah, so you could back off and see how you do, and if you notice, if your body is used to, because you're at, I was looking it up, you're at 30, 20 units, wait, you're on the 20 units. Yeah, so the .2. So say you go down to .1 and you're doing 10 units, and if that's working well and you're maintaining and fine, that's totally fine too. If you're a little, if you know, but what might happen if you've been used to the 20 and you go back to the 10, you might notice a little bit more of the hunger, a little bit more of that come out, so. There's, I'm comfortable with doing whatever works for you, and you don't have to worry about like, I've got this limited time, I can only be on this medication for this long. If it's working for you and you're happy with it, and you can afford it. So it's something that you can continue? Like, and does it? Yes.

ulld the more and more data that comes out about this, so I was actually just in a meeting this afternoon, we had our staff provider meeting, and one of the other providers brought up the fact that there are now studies coming out showing patients who have alcohol use disorder. That's what I was just gonna say. I saw it on the news. Yeah. That this girl went on it to lose weight, and then she's like, I used to drink all the time, now I don't drink. Yeah. So we're seeing benefits there. We saw, Wagovi now has an indication by itself for patients who don't have diabetes, who are overweight and have risk factors for, it's called MACE, major adverse cardiovascular event. So a heart attack or stroke. Yeah, that's like my sister. Yeah, so people who are at risk for that, Wagovi is now indicated to lower that risk. So we're getting more indications that are FDA approved. I mean, I'm seeing, I mean, somaglutide, like the GLP-1s have anti-inflammatory effects, and people with rheumatoid arthritis are seeing improvements that way. So right now, yeah, I mean, the GI side effects can be real, but most of the time they improve over time, and really, otherwise, these medications, they really act on some of the stuff that really causes chronic disease, and it really helps to control the, we call it cretins, that are produced by the stomach that tell the brain, I'm hungry, I need more food, and really helps to calm it down. I'm like a stress eater, so that is, I mean, it does take the stress. You don't feel that, you don't turn to the food for that. Yeah, well, and that's, I mean, for years and years, we're talking about chronic disease and obesity and the amount of chronic disease that, especially in the U.S., we have, but so much of it, and so getting that under control, and really, it helps lower those risks for other chronic disease issues, so.

I was just wondering if it causes any long-term, long-term effects from taking it. Long-term, I'm not seeing anything specific that's like, oh, this is too, you can only take it this much. Like, endocrine is hurting people later on. Right, exactly. So, and we do have, this is not, like, I mean, that's why everybody's worried, well, these are new, and are we gonna learn something? Yes, they're new words for this, but we've been using them for diabetics for probably over 15 years for this class of medications. Ozempic's been on the market for at least 10 years, so it's, they're not brand-new medications, they're just newer that everybody's using them for weight loss, because. So, my sister has had a couple heart attacks with that, it's some weird stress-induced heart attack, and it's something, it's like a Chinese. Yeah. Yoko something, I don't know. Yeah, what, yeah, the broken. Tongue goes, yeah. Tongue, broken heart. Broken heart. So, would that be, would that be good for her to take? I mean, could she take it? Because she's like. Probably. 400 pounds. Yeah, that's not a contra. Kind of a, any problems with that? Like, I know there's stuff she can't take. I mean, she would need to talk with her doctor and make sure, but. Well, her family's. Tacosobocardiomyopathy, yes, sorry. I was like, I know exactly what you're talking about, but I can't remember what it is. Yeah, I was gonna ask, because her family wants her to, and she's just always so protective of things like that. She won't try anything new. Tell her to talk to her doctor about it, and see what they think. But it you know there are some contraindications but heart disease is not a contraindication for us with your high blood pressure. No, if anything it's probably gonna help improve it. Yeah. Gonna lower the cardiovascular risk. Definitely help her. Yeah. So yeah tell her to talk to her doctor about it.

The only trouble I did have, I did quit taking it for a little bit because I had some gastro problems. I had to go in, they had to ultrasound my stomach. I had to go to the quick care. Oh okay. Yeah but it hurt so bad I was like I gotta go to quick care. Did they think it was from the Smegluzyme? No. Oh okay. He said it's well he said it is because it processes stuff you know different. Oh okay. But I just had to do like I just took that stuff that you get it like Walmart that it cleanses you. Like Miralax or something? No. Maxxitrate? Yeah something like that. Kind of like when you go get your colonoscopy. That's what I felt. I felt like this was happening to me again. Okay. But yeah but that and once that happened I've been fine. Then you've been fine. Yeah. So and that that's okay magnesium citrate is okay. You want to keep it for rare use. You don't want to be like relying on that. And constipation is common with with these GLP ones.

ulld that's doable? Yeah. This was like worse than pain. Yeah so that's why you want to really manage that constipation to prevent it from getting real backed up and causing that pain. So should I take something? So you can fiber like a fiber supplement like Metamucil can work really pushing the fluids because one of the things that happens even the appetite suppression that happens but also it kind of help suppresses your thirst. So sometimes people just aren't drinking as much. So really reminding yourself to drink and if you're noticing I don't naturally drink as much push the fluids. It's like I'm not drinking as much as before but at night I get thirsty. Yeah. Really really. I'll wake up in the middle of night and go get a big glass of water. Oh yeah. So it just dries I assume that's what it is drying my mouth. Yeah so try to during the day as much as you can push the fluids. Okay. Fiber like a fiber supplement like Metamucil is okay to take daily or Miralax is the other one that's safe to take daily. And and he had me get some pills. Did he? Docalax? Docalax. Docalax is a laxative. That one is okay but not a daily one. Okay. So that was like it yeah so Docalax is like a stimulant laxative like it gets things moving. Okay. It helps to kind of empty things out. Magsitrate is like even more so like. Yeah. Colonoscopy prep. I don't want to do that ever again. Yeah but it does it like a good bowel clean out sometimes if you're getting backed up is okay but you just don't want to rely on those stimulant laxatives all the time because one they become less effective and then they can affect your electrolytes. I don't take but Miralax is a powder and you mix that like in your coffee or in some juice or water or whatever and drink 48 ounces of like 4 to 8 not 48. Okay. Ounces of liquid with it and and that and then you can adjust that like so if you're having kind of the constipation symptoms you're just not regular you can adjust it where you start with a cap full of the powder and then if you start having diarrhea you can back off and do like a half a cap if you're like doing a cap full every day and you're still constipated you can do a little bit more. Okay. It's safe and all it all it does is that powder just absorbs liquid and then goes into your colon and keeps the liquid in there so it so it just makes it so it's not a stimulant. It's not going to throw off your electrolytes or anything, it's just going to bring more fluid, more liquid into your colon to help soften those stools. And so your stool comes out kind of more, it looks more like a gel, but then you can adjust that so that you're not, like it's not so watery. So that's also good to use. Just keep an eye on that and just actively manage that constipation so that you're not getting backed up like before. Let me go through your meds here and let's see.

Is there, instead of doing a cream for the hormones to come, is there a pill or something? You're doing the vaginal cream just twice a week? Well I do it, no I don't do it, I do it for two weeks and then I quit doing it. Oh do you yet? Okay. So I'm like, is there something there? There is, there's a little tablet or there's a ring we can do and it just depends on how your insurance is and coverage with that. So let's try, let's try the tablet, let's see. My husband gets discouraged and I'm like, I'm sorry, just keep on forgetting to do it. And it's just messy. It gets messy. And I'm like, I don't want that much wetness down there. So I'll just switch you over to the tablet, it's the same amount, and you just do it again twice a week. It should come with a little applicator, kind of like a tampon applicator, but it's a little tablet. We'll push it up. If not, the pharmacist can give that to you. Now do I have to get that from the place here or anywhere? Any pharmacy can do that. Okay, because that other stuff, I have to get it, the one. The Rick's Pharmacy? Yeah. Yeah. So that's Rick's Pharmacy, that's because it's cheaper there and sometimes your insurance doesn't cover the Premerin, but yeah, let's see, let's see how your insurance does with this one.

ulld I did get my shingle shot, so I need another one, but I'm going to just come in during the week and get it. It made me really sick. Oh, did it? And so I don't want to be sick this weekend. That works as well. It's not as weak. Yeah, that's true. And I can take a day off during the week. Okay. Yeah, I was so sick, but I got like my COVID and my flu, and they gave us a bunch all at one time. But then I was talking to other people and I figured it's probably bad. Yeah, the combination of those, but shingles is one that does cause that fever and it's not like COVID. Like COVID, usually the first one you don't get anything and the second one is when you feel really bad, but then this is not the same. Sometimes you get it on both, sometimes you get it on neither, sometimes it's just one or the other, so I can't predict it. I agree. Don't do it right before you want to celebrate for Mother's Day or do it when you've got a few days to be down if you need to. Central Town Drug. Is that where you want me to send this? Yes. Okay. We'll send that there. And then I'm going to take off this.

Oh, in my sleeping lately, I have not been able to get to sleep, so I start taking a third of another, so I take two melatonins, so I've been taking three of them. Melatonin or the trazodone? Well, I take them both. You're taking them both? Okay. Did that make a difference on the melatonin, like bumping that dose up? The last three days, it's helped me and I've been fine. And I don't wake up like in fact. I've been waking up better Okay, I'm feeling better Yeah Okay like I get up when my alarm goes off the other time that hit it like three times and I just So I feel like my sleep is probably gotten better.

Okay, I was really struggling So in the I mean and some of that is just This unfortunately this time of life that happens we get a lot of the sleep disruption How are you doing exercise wise? Are you getting regular exercise and you don't drink caffeine in the afternoon? I have cut down to one pop a day. Okay, and that's really try to do that earlier in the day Not look not an afternoon. Oh, I try and have it between three or before three o'clock Okay, so I have my coffee in the morning. Okay, and then I have a pop in the afternoon Okay, but I was I mean there's been times I drink like six to eight of them So you're that's it that's way better. Yep. Yeah, I mean that was a couple years ago I quit pretty much quit for a while and then I kind of have started The last year But I have noticed if I do it after three o'clock on yeah Thank you so much It's so nice outside they came up with flowers at my office. Uh-huh. I'm so jealous It's finally warmed up and I'm like, I'll get out there this weekend But I'm like everybody's like it's so nice. So can't wait to get outside Um a fluoxetine you're still taking that for the anxiety. Yes. How do you feel like that's working? Is that yeah, are you happy with that dose? We refill that Good good. I'm glad it was rough. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm glad that it's going better Well, and I was I had sinus infection last year and it lasted for like three months Uh-huh, and you weren't here and finally a guy that a doctor That I called in he called me in a prescription Oh, okay, it worked like and nothing had been working and I was so depressed and I was grouchy Like so you had left on vacation, oh gotcha and so I went through 4th of July and I was So grouchy to everyone I was like I've got to do something because this isn't me So he got me something that I just got over. Yeah a sinus infection. I thought oh, I hope this isn't starting again So if I do get another one, uh-huh. I want it. I don't know what it was It was doxycycline it looks like And so that's the that's the thing with with sinus infections is normally if you get cold it starts getting in there Yeah, give it some time try to let your body run its course. Yeah, if after about 10 days It's not getting better or or you get like you get the first few days It gets worse and you've got all that congestion and you start getting better and then it worsens It never gets better that we call that double worsening. Yeah, that's a sign of bacterial infection That's when it's time to start antibiotics, but the first I just had it and I didn't take anything Well, I took up like night well, yeah the first week to 10 days or so Sorry, I think I got cilantro from lunch in my teeth. It just popped out Hopefully I didn't have like a big old green thing But it's just popped out. I'm like, oh I can taste that. That's our anyway Yeah, the first seven first ten to fourteen days Usually like I said, most of the time the colds will come on they get all the congestion and then they start getting better but yeah, and so Allergies can like so changes season sometimes trigger those those sinus infections. So yeah, if it happens, let me know Other than that, I refilled your meds health maintenullce.

We've talked about diet exercise Smoking, you're not a smoker, you don't use street drugs or anything, alcohol, do you drink alcohol? Yeah. Like, how often? Sometimes two times a week, sometimes not at all. And like how many drinks? Like in a month, maybe four to six drinks I would say. Great, you're good, no worries. I've lost the wine. Yeah, here or there. Seatbelt, you wear your seatbelt in the car, put your phone away, don't text and try to... I put my seatbelt on. So when you're driving, hands-free. You use hands-free. Yes, I do. So put it away, don't try to be like fumbling it and that. So hands-free, you see your... Yeah, my car does all that. Perfect. Dentist, are you seeing a dentist regularly? Brushing and flossing? Just have me. Excellent.

ulld we're going to check the mammogram. The other thing, osteoporosis prevention, calcium, are you taking a calcium supplement or do you get much dairy in your diet? I don't. I don't like milk. I like yogurt and I like cheese. So if you're having three servings of dairy a day or more, you're good. But if you're like, I really don't... I'm kind of. You might be. Probably two. You might want to just take like a calcium supplement. Normally they come in, they're like about, the pills are like 500 or 600 milligrams of calcium. And you're supposed to take two of them a day. I would probably recommend just get one and take one a day instead of two a day. If you're getting yogurt and cheese, but not probably regularly getting that three servings. Yeah, it depends at night. Basically from about 35 on, our bones are losing calcium and we want to make sure there's plenty of calcium available so our bodies don't try to use our bones as a source of calcium. So that helps to prevent calcium, prevent osteoporosis.

Okay, let me grab you a gown and I'm going to have you change and then I'll come back in. So this just goes on. You just undress everything off from the waist up. It's kind of like a poncho. Like you've got to have your mammogram, right? Yeah. So there's like a tag. You put the tag here and then crisscrosses in the back, in the front. And there's a snap right there. Waist snap. Waist snap. So bra, shirt, take everything off from the waist up. Okay. Oh, are we doing a pap? I don't know. That's what I thought. Oh, let me look and see. Hold on. I was like, what? She didn't have everything out ready and I didn't see it on health maintenullce. So I don't think, let me see when your last one was due. I was not sure. And last year was normal. Yeah. I had a bad one. It's been a while since you had a bad one. So 2017 you had ASCUS. Let me just check and make sure. Make sure I'm not missing something. But normally, if it's normal and we don't need to keep you on a regular screening every five years is when we do it. And we did, in 2017 we did the COPO, right? That looked okay. Just minimal changes, HPV changes. And then we did the COPO in 2019. And that had a little bit of CIN1. And then it was normal in 2020. And was your HPV normal in 2020? HPV was negative. Last year it was normal and HPV was negative, so I think we can go at least three years, maybe five years. Let me, while you're changing, I'm going to go look that up and make sure that I'm giving you the right, but I don't think you need to have it today. Well, that's good. Yeah, exactly. So I'll just have you just undress from the waist up. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Okay. Okay.

Okay, perfect, okay, yeah, so I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, Just ran your specific qualier results through the, I can't remember, ASTCP is where we get our PAP guidelines and the management, and then there's an app and it tells like your, your risk and what your follow-up should be. And so yeah you should, we should do a PAP in three years from last year, so 2026, is when your next one's due. And then after that, if that one's still normal, then we go back to five years. So really, you're almost done with PAP. So we'd probably do that one and then I would do one in five years and then you'll be over 65 at that point, and you're good to go. Okay. Okay, I don't know. Okay, stay seated. Oh yeah, that's perfect, yep.

I'm gonna listen to your heart and lungs first and then feel your neck and then we'll do a breast exam. So take some big, deep breaths in and out. Good, and just breathe like you normally do. Lungs and heart are still great. Any pain or tenderness in your neck? Swallow if you would. How about swelling? Do you ever notice swelling down in your legs? No. No, my shoes are. Oh my boots don't fit down in my feet or something. Oh yeah, they've gotten smaller? I'm like, I have to put both fingers in there to feel them out. Okay, go ahead. I'm gonna have you put your arms above your head here and I'm gonna feel around first and then once I'm done, if I don't feel that spot, then I'll have you show me what you're, I don't know. Any pain when I'm pushing, let me know. Yeah, I don't feel anything on the outside. Let's see on this. Yeah, what you're talking about. Is that tender to push on it? Not terribly. No? I mean, it's not. This feels, yeah, it's nice and mobile, which that's usually nice and reassuring. Oh, okay. But yeah, let's get a mammogram and take a look. So I'm gonna order a mammogram and they'll do a diagnostic ultrasound. So it's a combination of both. Any pain or tenderness in there? No, not right now. Okay, yeah, I don't feel it. This is sort of, you know, that's how I kind of realized this because it was just so sore and I was like, oh my gosh. And then I'm like, wait a minute, this seems weird. And you said you noticed it about a month ago? Yeah. Has it gotten bigger during that last month? Has it gotten smaller? It seems bigger. Seems bigger. It just seems massive right now to me, but you know. Yeah, well, let's get that going. and uh we'll take a look and see what what that shows other than that lungs heart all sounds good everything else you're doing great so um i'll let you go ahead and get dressed and then let me what day is today friday um yeah 2 13 they don't they won't do a walk-in for this one but i'm wondering let me do you have time today let me have Maria just call over there and see if since you're right here see if we could get it going um and then if not then we'll get you next week all right i'll go ahead and get dressed i don't think it works like that i'm pretty sure it does right now you want a shot because the last three days i just want you so much crap just one shot calm you down yes she just wants one i just want one injection maybe two i have a cruise in like 20 days i need i need a shot of olympic i'm overeating how about a little phentermine or something but or just self-control just self-control but yeah i have three plates yeah um yeah thanks that's all that's all you're going to give me i'm not giving you some maglets i look at something you're like a toothpick like you don't need it um she's like yeah yeah our patients also lost um okay would you come over and see i don't know if they could um get her in for a diagnostic program and ultrasound um well i was just as she's here did see if maybe they could do it she's got a hard large mass no right best um so see if they can do it if they can do it today that'd be great but no i'll put it in right now but i was just i didn't go sit down at my desk so but or you know next week so so there you have it.

Well, I have, when you get into me, you notice, I know you said something about following up with my gallbladder that had the spot on it last year. Uh-huh. So am I going to have some kind of a test done for that? Yeah, we're going to take a look at that too. And have you noticed I'm a little hoarse and slimy? Yes. Again, I think it's, and it comes and goes, but it's, it's more, and I'm on the Asifax, I'm assuming it's still, yeah. Having a little issue. Yeah.

ulld are you also okay if I use the voice recorder today, ma'am? Yes. All right. It's like somebody tells you no when you do it. We just don't use it. And then I have to write it manually. I internally scream a little bit, but yeah. It's not terrible, you know. Okay. You know, actually, I'll tell you this, it significantly decreased the amount of work that I have to do on a daily basis, so. So your voice recorder, does it, does it record it into your computer somehow? It's just artificial intelligence and. I don't include any patient identifiers in there. In fact, all you guys are labeled as time instead of like initials or names or anything. So nobody knows. Oh. It's not associated with your chart. I'm at 820. Yes, exactly. Okay. Right. And then, uh, anyway, and then it documents everything exactly the way I would like for it to do.

So, uh, a year ago we talked about a gallbladder polyp and, uh. Since you had no pain, I would recommend for us to repeat an ultrasound. Yeah. So I'll order a right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound today just to monitor the gallbladder polyp to make sure it's not changing in size and it's stable. Okay. Some patients would like to remove the gallbladder. With the polyp because there's a very, very, very minuscule chance that gallbladder polyp can be cancerous, but I'm very conservative when I talk about for you to have elective surgery if you're not symptomatic. Okay. So unless there's a big change in the size of the polyp, that would change my recommendation, but if it's staying the same size and it doesn't look like it's changed at all, I wouldn't recommend it. Do you do anything different?

Okay, now I do have the, since we're on the right side of my body, I do have a, and I don't know what it is, I have no idea, but I'm still- And I've mentioned this to you before, I think, that I get a pain, and it's like a catching pain, and I thought, okay, if it's catching, it would be muscular, but it's very weird, it's right here, and I don't know, and it's- It's not hurting now, but it's, I mean, I can be just sitting there and all of a sudden it'll just hurt, not moving, not, like, if I was doing an exercise I would understand, but, so I don't know what's in that area. Okay, well, I'll take a look. All righty.

Ma'am, for your laboratory tests, because of the osteoporosis diagnosis, we would include an addition of the comprehensive metabolic panel and the lipid panel. We would also do vitamin D, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone testing.

You're up to date on your cancer prevention. I see that you had your mammogram earlier in August. It was normal. I recommend for another one next year. Uh, you're not qualified for lung cancer testing. I don't recommend for pap smers in your age group and for the bone density scan, you're not due until November of next year. Okay. Regarding colon cancer testing, I have here that you did your colonoscopy in November of 2017. Remind me when in Alex, I want to recall. 10, it was at 10, we said, yeah. Excellent. um besides for that right upper quadrant ultrasound i don't recommend for any other -imaging at this time. Okay.

The same thing with the vaccines. I would recommend for you to have Prevonar 20, Shingrix, Cov19 as a booster, and Hidos flu. Would you like any of those? No. Excellent. Any other questions before I move on to your exam?

I do still, I still get hot flashes from time to time, is that normal for somebody who's 68 years old, a woman that's 68? Yes. Why? I mean, I don't have ovaries, I don't have, you know, uterus, I have nothing. Yes. Why am I, you know. Your body craves estrogen. Oh, is that what it is? No. Okay, so. All right, then I'll. I don't recommend for you to use supplemental estrogen if it's manageable. No, I can manage. It's manageable. I've noticed. Estrogen increases your blood pressure, your risk for heart attack, and stroke, and blood clots, and breast- cancer. All kind of good stuff. I'm working on first. No, I don't want it. Yeah. And again, you know by now, the less is more, lady, I don't. Yeah.

I've noticed with my age that when I get bit by a mosquito, or especially an ant, but a mosquito, I never used to- the welts, I get the welts, and when I get ant bites, I mean, the mosquito bite will go away within, you know, a few hours or whatever, it won't be bad, but the mosquito- the empype will last for days and days. I mean, it is just, I just think that's something that's just normal with age, too. It can, yeah, so reaction can change with time, and the more that you get that, the more likely you'll react stronger. you can buy some over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream. Yeah, and that's what I'm using. I was just concerned about it being something physiological or whatever that would be, why they would just all of a sudden, I mean, I've had amphites all my life and stuff and never had this, and all of a sudden now I'm just like, they're horrible. It's getting worse, yeah. Answer getting bigger, I guess. I don't have a better answer for that, yeah. Anything else? See, I have weird stuff. That's okay.

Again, I mentioned the phlegm and the horsiness, and I'm on the Asifix, obviously, and I hate being on it, but I've been on it for 20 plus years or whatever it is, which I absolutely hate. The doctor that started me on it, we won't even- -go there. I wish I had you guys in, but you were maybe, no. But anyway, is there any, I know I can't get off of it at this point, you know, because it's just, I know it would be too much rebound, reflux, but would it do me well or would it not be worth it to try every other day using- a Pepcid AC versus using this Azevex every day because I'm, again, I'm worried about bone density and being on any kind of drug. Good question, good question. You can try it and I will tell you that Most of my patients that we try to pull off of a proton pump inhibitor like Asifax, and we switch them over to a second generation antihistamine like Pepcid. They hate Pepcid, and then their reflux gets bad, so. Okay. You know, I would say, like, maybe that's, like, 90% of the people I try to pull them off. Okay. You can do it, and if your reflux come back, you just go back to the acid. Well, yeah, I mean, I was thinking, but even, even every other day- Would it do, if I stayed on the [inaudible] reducing the amount I take, would that be helpful for me in the long run on, say, for bone density or anything? It's hard. Or is it not even worth it? I can't comment because I don't have a study that's been shown like, hey, I have a woman in her age range that takes Escovax daily and then I reduce it every other day and I put her on Pepcid AC. I can't comment on it because I don't have evidence to say yes or no. Would you like to conduct a study? No, no, no, no. So I would say that theoretically I don't think it will make a difference. Okay. I don't think it'll make a difference if you reduce the dose. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I do have a friend who's a retired pharmacist. I could probably ask him her theory of that too. Yeah. Because I know they have more information on the drugs themselves. Mm-hmm.

ulld then the other thing I get, and this is when I'm exercising, when I'm laying flat on the floor on my mat, and I've started to do, because I have arthritis everywhere. in my neck. And I started doing the turn of the head, as I'm laying down, I'm just turning it and holding it for X seconds, that second, and I find, man, when I do that, I get dizzy. Okay. And is that because of whatever I'm doing, obviously, turning my head, and then when I get up from that... Sometimes. You feel like that? A little, yeah. Does that last long? No, just a few seconds, yeah. Okay. So what's your theory on that one? That's pretty typical. Okay. Yeah, that's pretty typical. The fact that I'm turning my head, am I doing something? It's not a neck issue, it's an inner ear issue. Okay. So sometimes, so in the inner ear, okay, the way that we perceive rotational movement, we receive signal from three things mainly, our vision before, vision, hearing. sensation, like touch, and the last one is this organ called the vestibulocochlea, and you have fluid in the vestibulocochlea, and then there's little hairs that send signals in the vestibulocochlea. And when you move or rotate your body, the fluid in there also moves, and if the fluid does not stop moving, or if the hair perceives that there's continued signal, then you're going to feel that for a couple seconds, so that's not. Okay. That's not atypical. Okay.

Okay, all right, and just, this is curiosity for me, are you affiliated with, I know you're affiliated with Memorial Hermann, but are you affiliated with the Khalil Lake, whatever? Specialties? That's, whatever the new hospital is, HCA, whatever the one is over here, so you're strictly Memorial Hermann? Mm-hmm. Okay, okay, because if we ever had to go to a hospital, I want to make sure I go to. Yeah, so the ones that I can get all the information from would be Memorial Home in Southeast. That's the closest one to us. HCA is a black hole to me, I don't know what happens there. Okay. Really? That's a shame. I mean, I actually, like, HCA is the only hospital in Houston that does not use this electronic medical record, so we just don't know what happened. Like, UTMD I can see, Methodist I can see, MD Anderson I can see. Wow. You can see everybody but the one here in Cleveland. Well, my HCA is everywhere. I mean, HCA is. Yeah, I understand, but for our life, it's right here. Yeah. Okay. So I think the only thing, but you're going to check me here. Do I need to take my shoes off? I would like that, please. Okay. Yeah, and then if you don't mind, we're moving to your heart again. or to inject it in.

Yeah, the, because I did have a question about my, one of my feet, so. Go ahead. It's, and it's, and again, this is maybe arthritis, and I hate, I'm sorry I'm asking you so many questions, Dr. Mike. You do not mean so sorry, that's my job. But I, and. I'm happy to try to answer these questions for you. I'm just, I'm making you use your. all your medical expertise today. I don't know if I have a lot of medical expertise to use, but I'll try my best. That's fine. Hey, Jake, I'm asking your retired eye doctor who was great- Yeah, my brother. Yeah, I don't want to bother him, he's retired, he was an eye doctor. That's okay. It's my, it's my, actually my right foot. Yes ma'am. And you know I do a lot of exercises and what not. Yes ma'am. Well I dropped it off to get it after. Anyway, it's, it's, it's, doesn't hurt all the time, but it's like. Every now and then, it's a certain way I move it, and you'll tell me don't move it that way. I have a pain that is here, but it's not, I know there's nothing, you know, physically, you see, I can do all this. Mm-hmm. But I mean, it'll just hurt like crazy right here. There, okay. Yeah. We'll take a look at it. Okay. So what do you want me to do? Oh, don't do that. You can just sit straight, thank you. Do you mind lifting your hair slightly? You can go and learn it. Say ah, please. Ah. Thank you, ma'am. Again, I don't see any signs of skin cancer so far. I'm going to have to- Put your hands over like this, and go back like this. I'm going to look at your back now. And we do go to Dr. Gonzalez once a year for a once over. I trust him, or her, but you should have Gonzalez around. Yeah, she's wonderful. I trust her, but I'm just going to double check. That's fine. Okay. Okay, look towards the left for me. Take a deep breath and hold your breath. Breathe. Look towards the door, please. Deep breath and hold your breath. Breathe. I don't hear any extra noises in your neck either. Your heart sounds strong. Thank you. The lungs are completely clear. Sure. As your son's like this, I'm going to twist this way. And the other. Does that cause you to have any discomfort, ma'am? Not really. Good. Keep your hands down. And the pain is here? It's usually back here. It's like right in the, like, yeah, right there. Right here a little bit. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right underneath the rib. Mm-hmm. That's where it is. That's where it is. Want to grind my thumb against this? Well, I feel it. You feel it, but it's not that pain that you feel. Not horrible pain, no. Nothing in it? Mm-mm, no. What about when I tap? It's, uh, well. I think it's probably muscular. Okay. Directly underneath that rib doesn't really lie the kidney either. The only other organs in that area would probably be your liver and most people don't really have capsular pain from the liver. Plus your numbers have been all similar so I'm not so concerned about it. On the right upper quadrant ultrasound we may pick up something. Okay. But typically patients that have gallbladder or peptic ulcers or liver disease, they tell me they have pain in the front, not in the back, so I think this may be muscular in the low back here. Okay, that's weird. Lay back please. I mean, I do get pain in the front too, but as we come and go, and I always just, I always just think it's just gastritis. I don't know if it is or isn't, but. Can you call me? You've got great pulses. So the pain is here in this toe? Yeah, it's between the toe and kind of going up the foot. Yeah, right there. Yeah, that's it. But not a bob. No. Mm-hmm. Well, nothing's broken, which is good. Obviously, yeah. Yeah. So, I say, could you have arthritis in your foot? I think you can. You can, absolutely can, absolutely can. I have arthritis in my two big toes. And then the big thing I noticed is that you have a big callus right here. Yeah, and that, that is, I've had that, you see, I had surgery here. Mm-hmm. Because I had the big bone. Mm-hmm. And they, he, he did it, then it was a few years ago, and now this one's getting really big. Yeah. But I did have that, because it was actually hurting wearing shoes. Yeah, because I wonder if you have arthritis between here and that's why you have this couch form. Maybe, I don't know. That's my, that's my two cents. I'm going to fill in your time now. Okay. Do you have pain, want to press down now? Yes. All righty. I'm okay. You're not, you're not. Oh, sure, it's okay. Sorry, I misunderstood. Deep breath out. And no pain now? Excellent. Come on. You can put your shoes on and your shirt back on. Any other questions for me before I step out? I don't think so. Anything that I haven't answered. If you need a phone, make sure that you and I both can take it okay. No, it's stupid. I hate that, but it is what it is.

Oh, I did hit one more weird little thing. Yes, ma'am. What causes your outer ear to just be itchy? From time to time. I mean, laugh at me, dear, but you get it too, but I get it. I seem like I get it more often. I'm not sure you're going to have an answer with that. But the itchy outer ear, is there any? No, people's skin just itches. Sometimes there's a little irritation there when people's itching. Okay. I don't have a. Like a solve for it. I don't have a solution. That's fine. That's fine. I just. I probably wouldn't put hydrocortisone on your ear though. I mean some people do. I wouldn't recommend. Well if it's in your outer ear it's fine. Alright, I recommend for you to also follow up with me in 12 months for a Medicare annual wellness visit. Besides that, I think you're doing fairly well. I'll order your labs. Both of you guys can get it done today. Ma'am, I also ordered your right upper quadrant ultrasound. I'm not putting on your paperwork. How to schedule that? Okay, where is that done? Do you know where that's done usually? You can do that at Southeast or at the imaging facility in Lake City. That's probably the closest to this area. Okay.",,,

E78.5 Hyperlipidemia","Hello. Hi. How are you? Okay. Well, how are things going from a heart perspective? So I still don't have the strength that I used to have. Yeah. And I don't have the endurance that I used to have. Okay. So, I mean, it's, I mean, I'm doing everything. that I was before. Okay. I'm just not at the same level. Yeah. So.

ulld work is going okay, I think you told me last time you switched to a desk job, is that right? No. No? Oh, okay. I just, they were taking it easy on me, but not anymore. Oh, okay. And I just. Yeah, I mean, it's a really tough situation, unfortunately. I mean, you had recovery of your pumping function. Yeah. But obviously, your heart is not exactly the same as it was before this all happened, you know? So I know, like, if I lift heavy things and I have to carry them for a little ways, I do, man, I am... You're out of breath. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So it's, I mean, it's definitely different.

ulld I was talking to Dr. Anderson, my primary care, and he told me, he goes, Tom, he goes, he goes, well, first he goes. He goes, you're doing way more than what most people are doing at your age, so. Yeah, and that's the other thing. You're kind of in a young man's job. Oh, well, yeah, that, for sure. But, yeah, I mean, you have reduced pumping function on both sides of your heart as far as like, it's in the normal range on the left side, but it's at the lower end of normal. And then you have some dysfunction on the right side. And so. It's just not going to keep up in the same way that it did. Yeah. Which. So I did notice, so in January, in early January, I got sick. Uh-huh. And I mean, it was so bad, I went in and got tested for COVID and stuff like that. Yeah. And for strep and everything, and it came, everything came back negative, they, she said I just had an old-fashioned cold. Yeah. But it took I mean, it was, it was in December before I really started feeling any better. Started feeling better. Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't know, just, I mean, I usually, I mean, I get colds and stuff like everybody else, but they don't really knock me down like that one did. Mm-hmm. So, I was concerned that, man, maybe there's something going on that I don't know about. Yeah.

But no. Did you have any problems with, like, swelling in your legs or? No. Drastic weight gain, anything like that happen around that time? No, no. Okay. I do have swelling in my belly though, from weight gain. Oh, okay, okay.

How's your diet going? Are you trying to follow a more plant-based diet? So, what was it, in December I had my diabetic appointment and my A1c was 8.7. Oh. And so, yeah, we had a serious talk and so I'm, yes, I have a I'm trying to be better, I am, I am, so my wife's, my wife's not on me so much anymore, so it must be doing something better, so. That's funny. Yeah? Yeah, I mean, we really, especially in these situations, try to think of food as medicine. Oh, yeah. You know, and so. what you're putting in your body, it really does matter. It's, at this point, very critical. Oh, yeah, well, and he told me, he goes, Tom, he goes, if you keep doing what you're doing, you're going to kill yourself, so. Yeah, yeah. Did I ever give you one of those handouts with our diet program? Yeah, yeah. Did you do it? No. Okay, do you want another one? I don't care, yeah. Okay, I mean, I can keep trying to give you the information, but yeah, like what your primary said is. It's just, it's critical at this point. Yeah. So, and you don't have to be as drastic as this. I did this program too, all of us providers did here, and I've made some changes even, and I felt better. Okay. Like, meat's just not the way to go. Yeah. And that's what people want, you know, and convenience foods, and I mean, they have this great science behind making foods as addictive as possible. This is not easy to do at all. It's not going to be the food that you crave. But if you make the changes, and especially if you do really kind of get down to it and get rid of those foods, you will stop craving them at some point.

ulld see, I don't have a problem eating vegetables. Yeah. I'll eat vegetables. Okay. So it's, but, so my problem is, well, I'm working, I'm good. Okay. I mean, I bring lunch and I just eat it. Good. But then when I get home, you know, I'm not really hungry, but then, you know, it's like, oh, something sounds, that sounds good, oh, I'm going to eat this, and then, yeah. Are you bored? No, because usually I'm pretty tired, just when I go, I should just go to bed when I eat, because I mean, like, last night it was, I think it was 8:30 when I punched out last night, so I mean, yeah, I'm tired when I get home, so, but, and so Yeah, that's my big thing, biggest thing is, so for me, I try to eat a real light breakfast, a more heavier lunch, and then I should just eat a real light dinner. But usually what happens, I eat a light dinner, and then I eat my fourth dinner, you know, my [inaudible] Second dinner? Yes, second dinner. Okay, well. Yeah, I mean, these are not easy things to do, and if it was for 1 day, it'd be no problem, right? Oh, yeah. The problem is that it's every day for the rest of your life, it really needs to get dialed in. Yeah.

Did your primary happen to do a lipid panel when he was doing that other blood work? Do you know? What's that? A cholesterol check. I don't know. Okay. Whether or not, so. Did he talk to you about your cholesterol at all? Not that I know, I don't remember. Okay, probably didn't do then. You're really due for one. The last time that we did it was a little over a year ago, June of 2023, and your LDL was okay, considering the history, it was 72.6. Really, what we would prefer is that it's less than 55, given how young you are and that you've already had this very dramatic disease. So I think we should check it. If your A1c wasn't great, your triglycerides probably are not going to be great either. Those two are tied together, but I would like to know what that LDL is. Right now, we have you on the atorvastatin 80 milligrams, which is max dosing for statin therapy, but we have other non-statin medicines that we could add. One of them is Zetia, or ""Zetami"" is the other name for it. and it reduces absorption of cholesterol in your gut. So even if your diet's not 100%, it still helps. So if it was like it is, or like it was on your last one, or if it's even worse, I'm going to recommend we start that, but I think we should get the data -first and find out.

Okay. Okay? All right. The other thing is it's time to discontinue your Brilinta, it's been a year since you had your STEMI, and so after that we go to monotherapy with aspirin. Okay, so the Brilinta, is that the one that's. That's the. It's actually for my heart and for -my diabetes too? No, the Brilent is the SuperDuty aspirin. So that's, remember when you went back in with reocclusion and they were like, oh, you're a Plavix non-responder? Mm-hmm. So this is the medicine that we've been using instead of that. So it reduces platelet aggregation. So it's blood thinner. It's not, but yeah, sure, we can call it that. Okay. Basically, it makes your blood less sticky. And so that while that stent is first put in, it's not as smooth. Your body hasn't grown around it yet. Mm-hmm. And so platelets can stick to it and cause you to have a blood clot. Okay, you don't want that, obviously. But after a year, we feel pretty good about your body having grown around that stent and making it really smooth and that it's just not as big of a risk anymore. Now, we keep you on the aspirin every day for the rest of your life. Yeah. But we feel okay about taking you off of the Brilinta and saying, okay, you know, it's not as big of an issue. So we're not going to replace it with anything? Mm-mm, no, but you do need to take the aspirin every day, the 81 milligrams. But yeah, no, it's just, we're done.

Okay. And it's one less medicine you have to worry about. Yeah, all right. Okay? So I still have... Quite a bit of it left? Well, I think I got like a... like another 30 days where. If you want to take it, you can, if you don't want to take it, you don't have to, whatever you want to do. Okay, all right. So we'll just say therapy complete. All right. I don't think there's any other changes we necessarily need to make, how's blood pressure been at home? It was really good today. So the last time I checked it, it was like a 116 over 76. Okay, good. Yeah, I mean, it's, I don't check it very often anymore. That's okay. Because I mean, it's really. It's been dialed in. Yeah, I, so, yeah. Yeah, it was 124 over 78 today, which is a little higher than the home pressure, but you're walking in, you know, so, but it's still excellent. I don't have to deal with you guys. I know, I know, it's not fun. I feel for you, I do. But yeah, I think we're doing well there. Okay. And it doesn't sound like you're having chest pain, is that right? No, so there was, so I have those nitroglycerin pills. Mm-hmm. And I usually carry them with me. Okay. But I We went up and we cut some wood. Okay. And I forgot my pills. Okay. And I was cutting, I was working, I was sweating and stuff, and then it didn't hurt, but I felt some tightness. And so I just took a break for like about 15 minutes and then I went back to work, and of course I didn't tell anybody because I didn't want them freaking out. Okay. And then it, but it, I felt better, but that's the first and only time I've ever, it just, and I don't even know if it was tightness, it just felt different, you know? So, but I mean, I went to work the next day and, you know, it just. You did fine. Yeah. And you're still carrying these really heavy boxes. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. So I, yeah, I. Yeah, even I went to a place the other day and delivered a bunch of boxes and the lady there, she goes, obviously you're the type of guy that when you go to the grocery store, you only want to make one trip into the house with everyone. Yeah, all the time. I'm like, yeah, I don't want to go back. Oh, that's funny. So, but that was the only time that I've ever noticed something that was kind of off. And I'm not even going to say it was... It just might have been, I just might have just been tired. Right, well, that is a lot of work. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was, so, and But that, but yeah, and I'm just, I'm just telling you, I mean, I'm not, I'm not worried about it because I mean, that was, that was a couple months ago and it's nothing, nothing since. Let me know if it starts to happen again, I definitely would want to know about that, but if it's just one isolated event. Yeah. Okay. All right, yeah, but that was the only time I've ever, and like I said, it wasn't pain, it just, it just felt weird.

Okay. So, yeah. All right. I don't want to, what? Hang on. It's like frozen. I've never had this happen before. Hang on. It's like no you only get this much volume. Well, that's probably enough. Nice deep breath. Any problems with unusual bleeding, like black tarry stool? No, no. Legs look great, you haven't had problems with them swelling? Nope, no tingling or anything. Okay, oh good, oh good. Yeah, it's just, so. Okay, well, it seems like overall things are going okay, I mean, it's obviously not where you want to be, but. No, but, you know, my wife, she told me she goes, she goes blank. was just think where you were at a year ago at this time, so. Yeah, that's a good point, that's sweet of her.

So we'll do a lipid panel, which is the cholesterol check, and then you're also due for a chemistry. Have you eaten today? No. Okay, good. So if you have time to go over to the lab right after this, that would be great. So can this be done in Fruitland too? Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, if you prefer. Just because I won't have time today. Yeah, that's okay. But I can do it tomorrow. Yeah, that's totally okay. I got to go in there anyways because I have to do a low testosterone. Okay. So. Okay, so then yeah, that's perfect. Let me just see if you have other labs ordered here. Oh yeah, okay, it's just the testosterone. Yeah. Oh, you just did a metabolic panel in. In December. Yeah, maybe we don't actually need to do that. Okay, let me just take that off. All right, because I got a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah. I mean, I can't understand what they all meant, all of it. Yeah, no, it's okay. [inaudible] chart. Yeah, I should have looked at that first. But yeah, you're okay there. So we just need the lipid panel. And then basically, if we end up adding the Zetia, then I'll have you repeat a lipid panel in 3 months along with the chemistry to look at kidney and liver, and we'll go from there.

Okay. But we'll let you know that based on whatever happens with this lab. So we need refills on the spironolactone, probably... Oh yeah, and the Farxiga. So I just got some pills. Just this week. Okay, you don't have any more after that on these ones. Okay. So you don't have to necessarily pick them up now, but it's just a lot easier for me to send it in during the visit because we're actually chatting right now. Okay, all right. And it looks like Dr. Anderson does your olmesartan, so I'll leave that be. The atorvastatin needs to be refilled. -perol, had 1 refill that was just done, but we'll send in a year's worth. So, is there going to be any of these other pills for my heart that I'll eventually be able to get off of? Well, so when somebody has had a history of reduced pumping function, we prefer to keep the GDMT on board because we know that people do better. There's a bigger chance that you'll regress if we take those medicines off. Oh, yeah, I don't want to, yeah. So, unless something happens where we can't keep the medicines on, like reasons that that happens are your heart rate goes too slow, your kidney function deteriorates, stuff like that, then we re-evaluate based off of that. But otherwise, the medicines that you're on now are going to basically be the medicines we keep you on. Okay. If everything goes as well as we would hope it goes, you know. Okay. Which I know that's super, super frustrating because, you know, people don't like taking pills. Well, I mean, I've... Before all this stuff started happening with my diabetes and stuff, I never took any pills. Yeah. No, but after 2 years, I'm pretty much used to taking pills now, so. Okay. Yeah, I have a lot of patients that they stop taking their pills and we end up seeing them again in the hospital, so. No, I don't want to do that, I don't want to do that, so.

So tomorrow before you go get the lipid panel done, you can have water, you can have black coffee, just don't eat anything or put any sugar cream or anything like that in coffee. Okay. And then for follow-up, I would say that we could check back in in 6 months if you're okay with that. Yeah. Is it better to see me in Fruitland? I go out there now about 1 or 2 times a month. Yeah, I'd rather do it there. Okay. I'll tell you that you prefer, yeah. Okay. Any questions or concerns that we didn't cover? No, I don't think so. Okay. So So, do you just go to St. Peter's here in Fruitland? I do. Oh, okay. Yeah, so I've only done it once so far, but yeah, I will be going out there like 1 or 2 times a month. I also go to Meridian sometimes for a lipid clinic, so I'm kind of like going in different places, but yeah, we try to give at least some amount of appointment there. Just because we know it's really, like some people even drive 2 to 3 hours to get to see me there, so it's kind of. Oh, really? Yeah, it's kind of crazy, but there's just obviously people out kind of like in the wilderness and there's obviously no hospitals or clinics there, so. Try to meet them at least part way on that, so. No, I, yeah, because it's only 10 minute drive from my house to see [inaudible] Fruitland. Oh, nice. Okay, perfect. So yeah, I just put in that you prefer Fruitland for the follow-up appointment. So someone will call you in like 3 months and get that set up, okay? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. That'll work though. Yeah, and in the meantime, keep working on food, keep working on exercise, you know. I mean, obviously I don't have to say exercise because like that's basically what you do for a job, but. All right, let me get your paperwork and we'll get you out of here. Okay, all right, thank you. Yeah.",,,
